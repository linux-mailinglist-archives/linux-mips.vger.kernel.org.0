IMHO it might not be wise to add yet another header file for this purpose.
Instead lets use <linux/mmdebug.h> in line with DEBUG_VM, DEBUG_VM_PGFLAGS,
DEBUG_VIRTUAL (which is also a stand alone test). A simple grep shows that
the impact of mmdebug.h would be less than generic pgtable.h header.

Sure np, will drop it. But checkpatch.pl never complained.

Sure, will move it.

Could the helpers we are testing behave differently when DEBUG_VM is not set ? I think it's good the test things as close as possible to final config.

Makes sense. There is no functional dependency for the individual tests
here on DEBUG_VM.

(ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE || EXPERT) be moved along side MMU on the same line ?

This looks good, at least until we get all platforms enabled. Will do all these
changes along with s390 enablement and re-spin.
