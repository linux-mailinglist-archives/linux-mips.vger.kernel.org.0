This sentence was not very clear, let me rephrase it: I recommend
starting the review with Jiaxun's series, specifically examining the
code that has been incorporated into my series. This is important as I
have already made several modifications to his original code

Is it possible for you to apply the first patch of this series, which is
only a fix? This would enable me to have a slightly shorter
series. Additionally, it would facilitate dividing the entire series
into two parts: the first part for XKPHYS support and the second part
for EyeQ5 support.
