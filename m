Okay but FWIW the maintainers for all these enabled platforms cared for this test
at the least and really helped in shaping the test to it's current state. Besides
I am still failing to understand your point here about evaluating particular feature's
usefulness based on it's support on relative and perceived importance of some platforms
compared to others. Again the idea is to integrate all platforms eventually but we had
discovered build and runtime issues which needs to be resolved at platform level first.
Unless I am mistaken, debug feature like this which is putting down a framework while
also benefiting some initial platforms to start with, will be a potential candidate for
eventual inclusion in the mainline. Otherwise, please point to any other agreed upon
community criteria for debug feature's mainline inclusion which I will try to adhere.
I wonder if all other similar debug features from the past ever met 'the all inclusive
at the beginning' criteria which you are trying to propose here. This test also adds a
feature file, enlisting all supported archs as suggested by Ingo for the exact same
reason. This is not the first time, a feature is listing out archs which are supported
and archs which are not.

And there were valid reasons why s390 could not be enabled just yet as explained by s390
folks during our previous discussions. I just pointed out an example where this test was
useful as you had asked previously. Not being official supported in this version does
not take away the fact the it was indeed useful for that platform in discovering a bug.

Again will ask for some data to substantiate these claims. Though I am not really
sure but believe that there are integration test frameworks out there which regularly
validates each of these code path on multiple platforms. One such automation found
that V11 of the test was broken on X86 PAE platform which I fixed. Nonetheless, I can
speak only for arm64 platform and we intend to use this test to validate arm64 exported
page table helpers. Citing unsubstantiated past examples should not really block these
enabled platforms (arm64 at the very least) from getting this debug feature which has
already demonstrated it's usefulness during arm64 THP migration development and on s390
platforms as well.

Unlike those, the proposed test here is isolated as a stand alone test and stays clear
off from any other code path. I have not been involved in or aware of the usefulness of
existing MM debug features and hence will just leave them upto the judgment of the
maintainers whether to keep or discard them.

As I had mentioned before, the test attempts to formalize page table helper semantics
as expected from generic MM code paths and intend to catch deviations when enabled on
a given platform. How else should we test semantics errors otherwise ? There are past
examples of usefulness for this procedure on arm64 and on s390. I am wondering how
else to prove the usefulness of a debug feature if these references are not enough.
