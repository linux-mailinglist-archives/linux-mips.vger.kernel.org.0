+=========================
+Capacity-Aware Scheduling
+=========================
+
+Scheduling load balancing on Asymmetric Multiprocessor systems was improved
+through the introduction of Capacity-Aware Scheduling. It identifies the
+most efficient CPU to assign a task based on its capacity. This capacity
+may be asymmetric due to heterogeneous computing architecture such
+as ARM big.LITTLE. Scheduler gets information about asymmetric capacities
+when the scheduler domain hierarchy is built using build_sched_domains().
+CPU capacities are provided to the scheduler topology code through the
+architecture specific implementation of the arch_scale_cpu_capacity().
+The SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY flag is set by the scheduler topology for a domain
+in the hierarchy where all CPU capacities are visible for any cpu's point
+of view on asymmetric CPU capacity systems. The scheduler can then take
+capacity asymmetry into account when load balancing.
+
+Initial CPU capacities are derived from the Device Tree and CPU frequency.
+For RISC-V & ARM64 it is done in drivers/base/arch_topology.c. A cpu-map
+device tree is parsed to obtain the cpu topology and the initial CPU capacity
+is set using the CPUFreq subsystem. A callback is registered to the CPUFreq
+subsystem to rebuild sched_domains when CPU frequency changes.
+
+Asymmetric CPU capacity information is used in
+
+* Energy Aware Scheduling: The scheduler is  able to predict the impact of
+  its decisions on the energy consumed by CPUs. Described in :doc: `sched-energy` .
+* Optimized task wakeup load balancing by finding idle CPU with enough capacity.
+
+The different scheduler classes asymmetric use the Asymmetric CPU capacity
+information differently.
+
+**CFS capacity awareness**
+
+Used to identify misfit tasks:
+A load intensive task on a CPU which doesn't meet its compute demand is
+identified as a misfit task. 'Misfit' tasks are migrated to CPUs with
+higher compute capacity to ensure better throughput. CFS periodically updates
+the misfit status of the current task by comparing its load vs the CPU capacity
+using task_fits_capacity(). If the load is more than the CPU capacity the
+calculated misfit load is updated to the runqueue rq->misfit_task_load.
+This load is then considered by the load balancing operations to migrate
+the task to a CPU of higher capacity.
+
+Modified wakeup logic to support DynamIQ systems:
+When the scheduler class calls select_task_rq_fair to select a runqueue for
+a waking task, load balancing is performed by selecting the idlest CPU in
+the idlest group, or under certain conditions an idle sibling CPU if the
+domain has SD_WAKE_AFFINE set. In DynamIQ systems Last Level Cache (LLC)
+domain of a CPU spans all CPUs in the system. This may include CPU's of
+different capacities. So in select_idle_sibling() an idle sibling is picked
+based on CPU capacity for asymmetric CPU capacity systems and for symmetric
+systems use LLC domain is used. The policy is to pick the first idle CPU
+which is big enough for the task (task_util * margin < cpu_capacity).
+If no idle CPU is big enough, the idle CPU with the highest capacity is
+picked. For asymmetric CPU capacity systems select_idle_sibling() operates
+on the sd_asym_cpucapacity sched_domain pointer, which is guaranteed to span
+all known CPU capacities in the system. This works for both "legacy"
+big.LITTLE (LITTLEs & bigs split at MC, joined at DIE) and for newer
+DynamIQ systems (e.g. LITTLEs and bigs in the same MC domain).

-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Virtual Run Time or vruntime is the amount of time a task has spent running

-in the CFS scheduling class rbtree sorted by vruntime. scheduler_tick() calls
-corresponding hook of CFS which first updates the runtime statistics of the

-vruntime of the task based on the formula ::
-
-    vruntime += delta_exec * (NICE_0_LOAD/curr->load.weight);
-
-where:
-
-* delta_exec is the time in nanoseconds spent by the task since the last time
-  vruntime was updated.
-* NICE_0_LOAD is the load of a task with normal priority.
-* curr is the shed_entity instance of the cfs_rq struct of the currently
-  running task.
-* load.weight: sched_entity load_weight. load_weight is the encoding of
-  the tasks priority and vruntime. The load of a task is the metric
-  indicating the number of CPUs needed to make satisfactory progress on its
-  job. Load of a task influences the time a task spends on the CPU and also
-  helps to estimate the overall CPU load which is needed for load balancing.
-  Priority of the task is not enough for the scheduler to estimate the
-  vruntime of a process. So priority value must be mapped to the capacity of
-  the standard CPU which is done in the array :c:type:`sched_prio_to_weight[]`.
-  The array contains mappings for the nice values from -20 to 19. Nice value
-  0 is mapped to 1024. Each entry advances by approximately 1.25 which means
-  for every increment in nice value the task gets 10% less CPU and vice versa.

 put_prev_task
     Called by the scheduler when a running task is being taken off a CPU.
-    The behavior of this function depends on individual scheduling classes
-    and called in the following cases.
-
-    - When do_set_cpus_allowed() is called and if the task is currently running.
-    - When scheduler pick_next_task() is called, the put_prev_task() is
-      called with the previous task as function argument.
-    - When rt_mutex_setprio() is called and if the task is currently running.
-    - When user changes the nice value of the task and if the task is
-      currently running.
-    - When __sched_setscheduler() is called and if the task is currently

     In CFS class this function is used to put the currently running task back
     into the CFS RB tree. When a task is running it is dequeued from the tree.
     This is to prevent redundant enqueue's and dequeue's for updating its
     vruntime. vruntime of tasks on the tree needs to be updated by update_curr()
-    to keep the tree in sync. In DL(deadline) and RT classes additional tree is
-    maintained for facilitating task migration between CPUs through push

-    this queue if it is present on the scheduling class rq and the task has

 set_next_task
     Pairs with the put_prev_task(), this function is called when the next
     task is set to run on the CPU. This function is called in all the places
-    where put_prev_task is called to complete the 'change'. Change is defined
-    as the following sequence of calls::
-
-         - dequeue task
-         - put task
-         - change the property
-         - enqueue task
-         - set task as current task
-
-    It resets the run time statistics for the entity with
-    the runqueue clock.
-    In case of CFS scheduling class, it will set the pointer to the current
-    scheduling entity to the picked task and accounts bandwidth usage on
-    the cfs_rq. In addition it will also remove the current entity from the
-    CFS runqueue for vruntime update optimization opposite to what was done
-    in put_prev_task.
-    For the SCHED_DEADLINE and RT classes it will
-
-    - dequeue the picked task from the tree of pushable tasks.
-    - update the load average in case the previous task belonged to another
+    where put_prev_task is called to complete the 'change pattern'. In case

+    picked task and accounts bandwidth usage on the cfs_rq. In addition it
+    will also remove the current entity from the CFS runqueue for the vruntime
+    update optimization, opposite to what was done in put_prev_task.
+    For the SCHED_DEADLINE and RT classes it will remove the task from the
+    tree of pushable tasks trigger the balance callback to push another task
+    which is non running on the current CPU for execution on another CPU.

 Most of the rest of CFS's design just falls out of this really simple concept,
 with a few add-on embellishments like nice levels, multiprocessing and various
 algorithm variants to recognize sleepers.
