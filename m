Thank you for the detailed explanation. I think that splitting doesn't
help readability much in this case, but I realize that may just be a
matter of preference.

Please drop it, then. I don't think there is value in carrying this
complexity just because it makes the code more similar to the
neighboring clk code.

I'd prefer to keep the reset ids contiguous, so future hardware should
just get a different set of contiguous IDs, or new IDs appended
contiguously as you do in patch 7.

I'm fine with that.
