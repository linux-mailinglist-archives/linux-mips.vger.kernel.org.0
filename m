Generally it's better if the move can be done in one commit instead of
an add followed by a remove.

I see there are a bunch of MIPS PCI controller drivers in
arch/mips/pci/, so I see the argument for putting this one there as
well.

But most of the similar drivers are in drivers/pci/controller/, where
I think it's easier to keep them up to date with changes in the PCI
core.  Have you considered putting this one there?
