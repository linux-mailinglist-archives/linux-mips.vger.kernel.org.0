Patches 1-8 look good to me. Feel free to add my Reviewed-by tag to those.
I appreciate the care you took to make all those changes tiny and reviewable.

I'm still reviewing 10 and 14-18. 10 is a huge change and the diff is
pretty hard to parse.

Reading through all this code and considering the changes I'm
preparing for the TDP MMU have me wondering if it might help to have a
more general purpose MMU lock context struct which could be embedded
in the structs added in this patch. I'm thinking something like:
enum kvm_mmu_lock_mode {
    KVM_MMU_LOCK_NONE,
    KVM_MMU_LOCK_READ,
    KVM_MMU_LOCK_WRITE,
};

struct kvm_mmu_lock_context {
    enum kvm_mmu_lock_mode lock_mode;
    bool can_block;
    bool can_yield;
    bool flush;
};

This could yield some grossly long lines, but it would also have
potential to unify a bunch of ad-hoc handling.
The above struct could also fit into a single byte, so it'd be pretty
easy to pass it around.
