That doesn't look right. This clock source is not part of or coming
from the sc16is752. This belongs at the top level.

I think what needs to happen is of_serdev_register_devices() needs to
be passed the port index which can then be used to get the child with
a matching address/index.

There's not any DT binding that defines how this looks. It could be
either the slave devices are direct child nodes like you have or each
serial port should have a child node for the port and the grandchild
nodes are the slave device. I'd suppose it is possible to have
multiple devices muxed to a single port (that's what the comment is
about and handling muxed devices would require more work in serdev).
That binding would end up looking just like the former style and the
serdev core could have a hard time figuring out whether it is multiple
ports or multiple mux settings. I suppose we would be able to
distinguish that with the presence of mux-control binding or not. In
any case, all that needs to be considered before we change serdev.
