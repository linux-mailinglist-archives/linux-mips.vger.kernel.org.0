FWIW, hot off the presses is RFC9225:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9225

4.  Best Current Practises

   1.  Authors MUST NOT implement bugs.

   2.  If bugs are introduced in code, they MUST be clearly documented.

   3.  When implementing specifications that are broken by design, it is
       RECOMMENDED to aggregate multiple smaller bugs into one larger
       bug.  This will be easier to document: rather than having a lot
       of hard-to-track inconsequential bugs, there will be only a few
       easy-to-recognise significant bugs.

   4.  The aphorism "It's not a bug, it's a feature" is considered rude.

   5.  Assume all external input is the result of (a series of) bugs.
       (Especially in machine-to-machine applications such as
       implementations of network protocols.)

   6.  In fact, assume all internal inputs also are the result of bugs.
