I would assume that it is not prepared to handle two serdev subnodes and
assign the right gpios.

Unfortunately I also don't know how the serdev implementation really =
works.

It was my nagging to make it happen by persistently proposing a =
non-universal
solutionsome years ago until one of the maintainers had mercy to write a =
general
solution. So I could switch my driver to simply use the serdev API. It =
was for a GPS
client device but not a tty side driver.

I think if you look up the first patches for the serdev interface this =
should
reveal the original author an he should be able to help.

BR,
Nikolaus
