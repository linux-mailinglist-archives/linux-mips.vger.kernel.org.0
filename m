This has been fixed and now there is no need to set io resources manually.

I forgot to comment that all of these changes are rebased on the top
of staging-next.
Since this is a 'git mv' as I was told to do by Bjorn, last version of
the code is available
here [1] with the following added changes to the ones listed above
from previously submitted v1 series:

- Define PCI_IOBASE for mips (spaces.h) to avoid parsing io resources manually
so 'mt7621_pci_parse_request_of_pci_ranges' is not needed anymore.
- Don't store resources in driver private data but just get them to properly
set io window register and mips iocu memory regions.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Best regards,
    Sergio Paracuellos
