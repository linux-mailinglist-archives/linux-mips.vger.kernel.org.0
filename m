I'm still not following. In the above memblock_free_early() was taking 
(unsigned long)info . Was it a bug ? It looks odd to hide bug fixes in 
such a big patch, should that bug fix go in patch 2 ?

The commit is quite big (55 files changed, approx 100 lines modified).

If done in the right order the change should be minimal.

It is rather not-easy to follow and review when a function that was 
existing (namely memblock_free() ) disappears and re-appears in the same 
commit but to do something different.

You do:
- memblock_free() ==> memblock_phys_free()
- memblock_free_ptr() ==> memblock_free()

At least you could split in two patches, the advantage would be that 
between first and second patch memblock() doesn't exist anymore so you 
can check you really don't have anymore user.
