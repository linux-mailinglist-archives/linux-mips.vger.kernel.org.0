Subject: [PATCH v4 2/6] dt-bindings: interrupt-controller: Convert mti,gic to DT schema

Modern device tree bindings are supposed to be created as YAML-files
in accordance with DT schema. This commit replaces MIPS GIC legacy bare
text binding with YAML file. As before the binding file states that the
corresponding dts node is supposed to be compatible with MIPS Global
Interrupt Controller indicated by the "mti,gic" compatible string and
to provide a mandatory interrupt-controller and '#interrupt-cells'
properties. There might be optional registers memory range,
"mti,reserved-cpu-vectors" and "mti,reserved-ipi-vectors" properties
specified.

MIPS GIC also includes a free-running global timer, per-CPU count/compare
timers, and a watchdog. Since currently the GIC Timer is only supported the
DT schema expects an IRQ and clock-phandler charged timer sub-node with
"mti,mips-gic-timer" compatible string.

I don't really know who is the corresponding driver maintainer, so I
added Paul to the maintainers property since he used to be looking for the
MIPS arch and Thomas looking after it now. Any idea what email should be
specified there instead?

Changelog prev:
- Since timer sub-node has no unit-address, the node shouldn't be named
  with one. So alter the MIPS GIC bindings to have a pure "timer"
  sub-node.
- Discard allOf: [ $ref: /schemas/interrupt-controller.yaml# ].
- Since it's a conversion patch use GPL-2.0-only SPDX header.

-MIPS Global Interrupt Controller (GIC)
-
-The MIPS GIC routes external interrupts to individual VPEs and IRQ pins.
-It also supports local (per-processor) interrupts and software-generated
-interrupts which can be used as IPIs.  The GIC also includes a free-running
-global timer, per-CPU count/compare timers, and a watchdog.
-
-Required properties:
-- compatible : Should be "mti,gic".
-- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
-- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
-  interrupt specifier.  Should be 3.
-  - The first cell is the type of interrupt, local or shared.
-    See <include/dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/mips-gic.h>.
-  - The second cell is the GIC interrupt number.
-  - The third cell encodes the interrupt flags.
-    See <include/dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h> for a list of valid
-    flags.
-
-Optional properties:
-- reg : Base address and length of the GIC registers.  If not present,
-  the base address reported by the hardware GCR_GIC_BASE will be used.
-- mti,reserved-cpu-vectors : Specifies the list of CPU interrupt vectors
-  to which the GIC may not route interrupts.  Valid values are 2 - 7.
-  This property is ignored if the CPU is started in EIC mode.
-- mti,reserved-ipi-vectors : Specifies the range of GIC interrupts that are
-  reserved for IPIs.
-  It accepts 2 values, the 1st is the starting interrupt and the 2nd is the size
-  of the reserved range.
-  If not specified, the driver will allocate the last 2 * number of VPEs in the
-  system.
-
-Required properties for timer sub-node:
-- compatible : Should be "mti,gic-timer".
-- interrupts : Interrupt for the GIC local timer.
-
-Optional properties for timer sub-node:
-- clocks : GIC timer operating clock.
-- clock-frequency : Clock frequency at which the GIC timers operate.
-
-Note that one of clocks or clock-frequency must be specified.
-
-Example:
-
-	gic: interrupt-controller@1bdc0000 {
-		compatible = "mti,gic";
-		reg = <0x1bdc0000 0x20000>;
-
-		interrupt-controller;
-		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
-
-		mti,reserved-cpu-vectors = <7>;
-		mti,reserved-ipi-vectors = <40 8>;
-
-		timer {
-			compatible = "mti,gic-timer";
-			interrupts = <GIC_LOCAL 1 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
-			clock-frequency = <50000000>;
-		};
-	};
-
-	uart@18101400 {
-		...
-		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
-		interrupts = <GIC_SHARED 24 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
-		...
