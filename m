Indeed. Thanks for pointing that out. In the last days several times I
was looking at that line and for some reason UNCAC_BASE seemed as
CAC_BASE to me.) Based on what both IO_BASE and UNCAC_BASE are defined
as of the uncached region anyway, then it should be safe for any
currently supported MIPS64 (including the Loongson's) to use ioremap()
in place of dmi_early_remap(). So basically my current patch in the
subject won't change the method semantics. Let's not to try to fix a
problem which doesn't exist then, and keep the patch as is especially
seeing that the alternatives might still cause some troubles. Will you
be ok with that?
