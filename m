+CFS Overview
+=============
+
+Linux 2.6.23 introduced a modular scheduler core and a Completely Fair
+Scheduler (CFS) implemented as a scheduling module. A brief overview of the
+CFS design is provided in :doc:`sched-design-CFS`
+
+In addition there have been many improvements to the CFS, a few of which are
+
+**Thermal Pressure**:
+Scale CPU capacity mechanism for CFS so it knows how much CPU capacity is left
+for its use after higher priority sched classes (RT, DL), IRQs and
+'Thermal Pressure' have reduced the 'original' CPU capacity.
+Thermal pressure on a CPU means the maximum possible capacity is
+unavailable due to thermal events.
+
+** Optimizations to NUMA balancing**:
+When gathering NUMA statistics, information about whether a core is Idle
+is also cached. In case of an imbalance, instead of doing a second scan of
+the node runqueues, the idle core is used as the migration target. When
+doing so multiple tasks can attempt to select an idle CPU but fail, because
+a NUMA balance is active on that CPU. In this case an alternative idle CPU
+scanned. Another optimization is to terminate the search for swap candidate
+when a reasonable one is found instead of searching all the CPUs on the
+target domain.
+
+**Asymmetric CPU capacity wakeup scan**:
+Previous assumption that CPU capacities within an SD_SHARE_PKG_RESOURCES
+domain (sd_llc) are homogeneous didn't hold for newer generations of big.LITTLE
+systems (DynamIQ) which can accommodate CPUs of different compute capacity
+within a single LLC domain. A new idle sibling helper function was added
+which took CPU capacity into account. The policy is to pick the first idle
+CPU which is big enough for the task (task_util * margin < cpu_capacity).
+If no idle CPU is big enough, the idle CPU with the highest capacity is
+picked.
+
+**Optimized idle core selection**:
+Skipped looping through all the threads of a core to evaluate if the
+core is idle or not. If a thread of a core is not idle, evaluation of
+other threads of the core can be skipped.
+
+**Load balance aggressively for SCHED_IDLE CPUs**:
+Newly-woken task is preferred to be  enqueued on a SCHED_IDLE CPU instead
+of other busy or idle CPUs. Also load balancer is made to migrate tasks more
+aggressively to a SCHED_IDLE CPU.Â Fair scheduler now does the next
+load balance soon after the last non-SCHED_IDLE task is dequeued from a
+runqueue, i.e. making the CPU SCHED_IDLE. Also the the busy_factor
+used with the balance interval to prevent frequent load balancing
+is ignored for such CPU's.
+
+**Load balancing algorithm Reworked**:
+Some heuristics in the load balancing algorithm became meaningless because
+of the rework of the scheduler's metrics like the introduction of PELT.
+Those heuristics were removed. The new load balancing algorithm also fixes
+several pending wrong tasks placement
+
+ * the 1 task per CPU case with asymmetric system
+ * the case of CFS task preempted by other class
+ * the case of tasks not evenly spread on groups with spare capacity
+
+Also the load balance decisions have been consolidated in the 3 separate
+functions.
+* update_sd_pick_busiest() select the busiest sched_group.
+* find_busiest_group() checks if there is an imbalance between local and
+busiest group.
+* calculate_imbalance() decides what have to be moved.
+
+**Energy-aware wake-ups speeded up**:
+Algorithmic complexity of the EAS was reduced from O(n^2) to O(n).
+Previous algorithm resulted in prohibitively high wake-up latencies on
+systems with complex energy models, such as systems with per-CPU DVFS.
+The EAS wake-up path was re-factored to compute the energy 'delta' on a
+per-performance domain basis, rather than the whole system.
+
+**Selection of an energy-efficient CPU on task wake-up**:
+An Energy efficient CPU is found by estimating the impact on system-level
+active energy resulting from the placement of the task on the CPU with the
+highest spare capacity in each performance domain. Energy Model (EM) is
+used for this. This strategy spreads tasks in a performance domain and avoids overly
+aggressive task packing. The best CPU energy-wise is then selected if it
+saves a large enough amount of energy with respect to prev_cpu.
+
+**Consider misfit tasks when load-balancing**:
+A task which ends up on a CPU which doesn't suit its compute demand is
+identified as a misfit task in asymmetric CPU capacity systems. These
+'misfit' tasks are migrated to CPUs with higher compute capacity to ensure
+better throughput. A new group_type: group_misfit_task is added and indicates this
+scenario. Tweaks to the load-balance code are done to make the migrations
+happen. Misfit balancing is done between a source group of lower per-CPU
+capacity and destination group of higher compute capacity. Otherwise, misfit
+balancing is ignored.
+
+
+**Make schedstats a runtime tunable that is disabled by default**:
+A kernel command-line and sysctl tunable was added to enable or disable
+schedstats on demand (when it's built in). It is disabled by default.
+The benefits are dependent on how scheduler-intensive the workload is.

 ====================
 Scheduler overview
 ====================
+
+Linux kernel implements priority-based scheduling. More than one process are
+allowed to run at any given time and each process is allowed to run as if it
+were the only process on the system. The process scheduler coordinates which
+process runs when. In that context, it has the following tasks:
+
+* share CPU cores equally among all currently running processes.
+* pick appropriate process to run next if required, considering scheduling
+  class/policy and process priorities.
+* balance processes between multiple cores in SMP systems.
+
+The scheduler attempts to be responsive for I/O bound processes and efficient
+for CPU bound processes. The scheduler also applies different scheduling
+policies for real time and normal processes based on their respective
+priorities. Higher priorities in the kernel have a numerical smaller
+value. Real time priorities range from 1 (highest) â 99 whereas normal
+priorities range from 100 â 139 (lowest). Scheduler implements many scheduling
+classes which encapsulate a particular scheduling policy. Each scheduling
+policy implements scheduler handling of tasks that belong to a particular
+priority. SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR policies handle real time priorities tasks
+while SCHED_NORMAL and SCHED_BATCH policies handle tasks with normal priorities.
+SCHED_IDLE is also a normal scheduling policy when means its priority can
+be set between 100 â 139 range too but they are treated as priority 139.
+Their priority doesn't matter since they get minimal weight WEIGHT_IDLEPRI=3.
+SCHED_DEADLINE policy tasks have negative priorities, reflecting
+the fact that any of them has higher priority than RT and NORMAL/BATCH tasks.
+
+And then there are the maintenance scheduler classes: idle sched class and
+stop sched class. Idle class doesn't manage any user tasks and so doesn't
+implement a policy. Its idle tasks 'swapper/X' has priority 120 and and aren't
+visible to user space. Idle tasks are responsible for by putting the CPUs
+into deep idle states when there is no work to do.
+Stop sched class is also used internally by the kernel doesn't implement any
+scheduling policy. Stopper tasks 'migration/X' disguise as as a SCHED_FIFO
+task with priority 139. Stopper tasks are a mechanism to force a CPU to stop
+running everything else and perform a specific task. As this is the
+highest-priority class, it can preempt everything else and nothing ever
+preempts it. It is used by one CPU to stop another in order to run a specific
+function, so it is only available on SMP systems. This class is used by the
+kernel for task migration.
+
+
+Process Management
+==================
+
+Each process in the system is represented by struct task_struct. When a
+process/thread is created, the kernel allocates a new task_struct for it.
+The kernel then stores this task_struct in an RCU list. Macro next_task()
+allows a process to obtain its next task and for_each_process() macro enables
+traversal of the list.
+
+Frequently used fields of the task struct are:
+
+*state:* The running state of the task. The possible states are:
+
+* TASK_RUNNING: The task is currently running or in a run queue waiting
+  to run.
+* TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE: The task is sleeping waiting for some event to occur.
+  This task can be interrupted by signals. On waking up the task transitions
+  to TASK_RUNNING.
+* TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE: Similar to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE but does not wake
+  up on signals. Needs an explicit wake-up call to be woken up. Contributes
+  to loadavg.
+* __TASK_TRACED: Task is being traced by another task like a debugger.
+* __TASK_STOPPED: Task execution has stopped and not eligible to run.
+  SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP etc causes this state.  The task can be continued by
+  the signal SIGCONT.
+* TASK_PARKED: State to support kthread parking/unparking.
+* TASK_DEAD: If a task dies, then it sets TASK_DEAD in tsk->state and calls
+  schedule one last time. The schedule call will never return.
+* TASK_WAKEKILL: It works like TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE with the bonus that it
+  can respond to fatal signals.
+* TASK_WAKING: To handle concurrent waking of the same task for SMP.
+  Indicates that someone is already waking the task.
+* TASK_NOLOAD: To be used along with TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE to indicate
+  an idle task which does not contribute to loadavg.
+* TASK_NEW: Set during fork(), to guarantee that no one will run the task,
+  a signal or any other wake event cannot wake it up and insert it on
+  the runqueue.
+
+*exit_state* : The exiting state of the task. The possible states are:
+
+* EXIT_ZOMBIE: The task is terminated and waiting for parent to collect
+  the exit information of the task.
+* EXIT_DEAD: After collecting the exit information the task is put to
+  this state and removed from the system.
+
+*static_prio:* Nice value of a task. The value of this field does
+ not change.  Value ranges from -20 to 19. This value is mapped to nice
+ value and used in the scheduler.
+
+*prio:* Dynamic priority of a task. Previously a function of static
+ priority and tasks interactivity. Value not used by CFS scheduler but used
+ by the RT scheduler. Might be boosted by interactivity modifiers. Changes
+ upon fork, setprio syscalls, and whenever the interactivity estimator
+ recalculates.
+
+*normal_prio:* Expected priority of a task. The value of static_prio
+ and normal_prio are the same for non-real-time processes. For real time
+ processes value of prio is used.
+
+*rt_priority:* Field used by real time tasks. Real time tasks are
+ prioritized based on this value.
+
+*sched_class:* Pointer to sched_class CFS structure.
+
+*sched_entity:* Pointer to sched_entity CFS structure.
+
+*policy:* Value for scheduling policy. The possible values are:
+
+* SCHED_NORMAL: Regular tasks use this policy.
+* SCHED_BATCH: Tasks which need to run longer without preemption
+  use this policy. Suitable for batch jobs.
+* SCHED_IDLE: Policy used by background tasks.
+* SCHED_FIFO & SCHED_RR: These policies for real time tasks. Handled by
+  real time scheduler.
+* SCHED_DEADLINE: Tasks which are activated on a periodic or sporadic fashion
+  use this policy. This policy implements the Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
+  scheduling algorithm. This policy is explained in detail in the
+  :doc:`sched-deadline` documentation.
+
+*nr_cpus_allowed:* Bit field containing tasks affinity towards a set of
+ CPU cores.  Set using sched_setaffinity() system call.
+
+New processes are created using the fork() system call which is described
+at manpage :manpage:`FORK(2)` or the clone system call described at
+:manpage:`CLONE(2)`.
+Users can create threads within a process to achieve parallelism. Threads
+share address space, open files and other resources of the process. Threads
+are created like normal tasks with their unique task_struct, but clone()
+is provided with flags that enable the sharing of resources such as address
+space ::
+
+	clone(CLONE_VM | CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGHAND, 0);
+
+The scheduler schedules task_structs so from scheduler perspective there is
+no difference between threads and processes. Threads are created using
+the system call pthread_create described at :manpage:`PTHREAD_CREATE(3)`
+POSIX threads creation is described at :manpage:`PTHREADS(7)`
+
+The Scheduler Entry Point
+=========================
+
+The main scheduler entry point is an architecture independent schedule()
+function defined in kernel/sched/core.c. Its objective is to find a process in
+the runqueue list and then assign the CPU to it. It is invoked, directly
+or in a lazy (deferred) way from many different places in the kernel. A lazy
+invocation does not call the function by its name, but gives the kernel a
+hint by setting a flag TIF_NEED_RESCHED. The flag is a message to the kernel
+that the scheduler should be invoked as soon as possible because another
+process deserves to run.
+
+Following are some places that notify the kernel to schedule:
+
+* scheduler_tick()
+
+* Running task goes to sleep state : Right before a task goes to sleep,
+  schedule() will be called to pick the next task to run and the change
+  its state to either TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE or TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE. For
+  instance, prepare_to_wait() is one of the functions that makes the
+  task go to the sleep state.
+
+* try_to_wake_up()
+
+* yield()
+
+* wait_event()
+
+* cond_resched() : It gives the scheduler a chance to run a higher-priority
+  process.
+
+* cond_resched_lock() : If a reschedule is pending, drop the given lock,
+  call schedule, and on return reacquire the lock.
+
+* do_task_dead()
+
+* preempt_schedule() : The function checks whether local interrupts are
+  enabled and the preempt_count field of current is zero; if both
+  conditions are true, it invokes schedule() to select another process
+  to run.
+
+* preempt_schedule_irq()
+
+Calling functions mentioned above leads to a call to __schedule(). Note
+that preemption must be disabled before it is called and enabled after
+the call using preempt_disable and preempt_enable functions family.
+
+
+The steps during invocation are:
+--------------------------------
+1. Disable preemption to avoid another task preempting the scheduling
+   thread itself.
+2. Retrieve the runqueue of current processor and its lock is obtained to
+   allow only one thread to modify the runqueue at a time.
+3. The state of the previously executed task when the schedule()
+   was called is examined. If it is not runnable and has not been
+   preempted in kernel mode, it is removed from the runqueue. If the
+   previous task has non-blocked pending signals, its state is set to
+   TASK_RUNNING and left in the runqueue.
+4. Scheduler classes are iterated and the corresponding class hook to
+   pick the next suitable task to be scheduled on the CPU is called.
+   Since most tasks are handled by the sched_fair class, a shortcut to this
+   class is implemented in the beginning of the function.
+5. TIF_NEED_RESCHED and architecture specific need_resched flags are cleared.
+6. If the scheduler class picks a different task from what was running
+   before, a context switch is performed by calling context_switch().
+   Internally, context_switch() switches to the new task's memory map and
+   swaps the register state and stack. If scheduler class picked the same
+   task as the previous task, no task switch is performed and the current
+   task keeps running.
+7. Balance callback list is processed. Each scheduling class can migrate tasks
+   between CPUs to balance load. These load balancing operations are queued
+   on a Balance callback list which get executed when balance_callback() is
+   called.
+8. The runqueue is unlocked and preemption is re-enabled. In case
+   preemption was requested during the time in which it was disabled,
+   schedule() is run again right away.
+
+Scheduler State Transition
+==========================
+
+A very high level scheduler state transition flow with a few states can
+be depicted as follows. ::
+
+                                       *
+                                       |

+Scheduler provides trace events tracing all major events of the scheduler.
+The trace events are defined in ::
+
+  include/trace/events/sched.h
+
+Using these trace events it is possible to model the scheduler state transition
+in an automata model. The following journal paper discusses such modeling:
+
+Daniel B. de Oliveira, RÃ´mulo S. de Oliveira, Tommaso Cucinotta, **A thread
+synchronization model for the PREEMPT_RT Linux kernel**, *Journal of Systems
+Architecture*, Volume 107, 2020, 101729, ISSN 1383-7621,
+https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sysarc.2020.101729.
+
+To model the scheduler efficiently the system was divided in to generators
+and specifications. Some of the generators used were "need_resched",
+"sleepable" and "runnable", "thread_context" and "scheduling context".
+The specifications are the necessary and sufficient conditions to call
+the scheduler. New trace events were added to specify the generators
+and specifications. In case a kernel event referred to more than one
+event, extra fields of the kernel event was used to distinguish between
+automation events. The final model was generated from parallel composition
+of all generators and specifications which composed of 34 events,
+12 generators and 33 specifications. This resulted in 9017 states, and
+20103 transitions.

+=========================
+Capacity-Aware Scheduling
+=========================
+
+Scheduling load balancing on Asymmetric Multiprocessor systems was improved
+through the introduction of Capacity-Aware Scheduling. It identifies the
+most efficient CPU to assign a task based on its capacity. This capacity
+may be asymmetric due to heterogeneous computing architecture such
+as ARM big.LITTLE. Scheduler gets information about asymmetric capacities
+when the scheduler domain hierarchy is built using build_sched_domains().
+CPU capacities are provided to the scheduler topology code through the
+architecture specific implementation of the arch_scale_cpu_capacity().
+The SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY flag is set by the scheduler topology for a domain
+in the hierarchy where all CPU capacities are visible for any cpu's point
+of view on asymmetric CPU capacity systems. The scheduler can then take
+capacity asymmetry into account when load balancing.
+
+Initial CPU capacities are derived from the Device Tree and CPU frequency.
+For RISC-V & ARM64 it is done in drivers/base/arch_topology.c. A cpu-map
+device tree is parsed to obtain the cpu topology and the initial CPU capacity
+is set using the CPUFreq subsystem. A callback is registered to the CPUFreq
+subsystem to rebuild sched_domains when CPU frequency changes.
+
+Asymmetric CPU capacity information is used in
+
+* Energy Aware Scheduling: The scheduler is  able to predict the impact of
+  its decisions on the energy consumed by CPUs. Described in :doc:`sched-energy` .
+* Optimized task wakeup load balancing by finding idle CPU with enough capacity.
+
+The different scheduler classes asymmetric use the Asymmetric CPU capacity
+information differently.
+
+CFS Capacity Awareness
+======================
+
+Used to identify misfit tasks:
+A load intensive task on a CPU which doesn't meet its compute demand is
+identified as a misfit task. 'Misfit' tasks are migrated to CPUs with
+higher compute capacity to ensure better throughput. CFS frequently updates
+the misfit status of the current task by comparing its utilization vs the
+CPU capacity using task_fits_capacity(). If the utilization is more than the
+CPU capacity the calculated misfit load is updated to the runqueue
+rq->misfit_task_load. This misfit load is then checked by the load
+balancing operations to migrate the task to a CPU of higher capacity.
+
+Modified wakeup logic to support DynamIQ systems:
+When the scheduler class calls select_task_rq_fair to select a runqueue for
+a waking task, load balancing is performed by selecting the idlest CPU in
+the idlest group, or under certain conditions an idle sibling CPU if the
+domain has SD_WAKE_AFFINE set. In DynamIQ systems Last Level Cache (LLC)
+domain of a CPU spans all CPUs in the system. This may include CPU's of
+different capacities. So in select_idle_sibling() an idle sibling is picked
+based on CPU capacity for asymmetric CPU capacity systems and for symmetric
+systems use LLC domain is used. The policy is to pick the first idle CPU
+which is big enough for the task (task_util * margin < cpu_capacity).
+If no idle CPU is big enough, the idle CPU with the highest capacity is
+picked. For asymmetric CPU capacity systems select_idle_sibling() operates
+on the sd_asym_cpucapacity sched_domain pointer, which is guaranteed to span
+all known CPU capacities in the system. This works for both "legacy"
+big.LITTLE (LITTLEs & bigs split at MC, joined at DIE) and for newer
+DynamIQ systems (e.g. LITTLEs and bigs in the same MC domain).
+
+
+RT Capacity Awareness
+=====================
+
+Since RT tasks doesn't have a per task utilization signal RT tasks uses uclamp
+to guarantee a minimum performance point. Utilization clamping is a mechanism
+which allows to "clamp" (i.e. filter) the utilization generated by RT and
+FAIR tasks within a range defined by user-space. It exposes to user-space a
+new set of per-task attributes the scheduler can use as hints about the
+expected/required utilization for a task. RT is made capacity aware
+by ensuring that the capacity of the CPU is >= uclamp_min value. This check
+is done in the rt_task_fits_capacity()
+
+DL Capacity Awareness

+=========================
+Scheduler Data Structures
+=========================
+
+The main parts of the Linux scheduler are:
+
+Runqueue
+~~~~~~~~
+
+:c:type:`struct rq <rq>` is the central data structure of process
+scheduling. It keeps track of tasks that are in a runnable state assigned
+for a particular processor. Each CPU has its own run queue and stored in a
+per CPU array::
+
+    DEFINE_PER_CPU(struct rq, runqueues);
+
+Access to the queue requires locking and lock acquire operations must be
+ordered by ascending runqueue. Macros for accessing and locking the runqueue
+are provided in::
+
+    kernel/sched/sched.h
+
+The runqueue contains scheduling class specific queues and several scheduling
+statistics.
+
+Scheduling entity
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+Scheduler uses scheduling entities which contain sufficient information to
+actually accomplish the scheduling job of a task or a task-group. The
+scheduling entity may be a group of tasks or a single task. Every task is
+associated with a sched_entity structure. CFS adds support for nesting of
+tasks and task groups. Each scheduling entity may be run from its parents
+runqueue. The scheduler traverses the sched_entity hierarchy to pick the
+next task to run on the CPU. The entity gets picked up from the cfs_rq on
+which it is queued and its time slice is divided among all the tasks on its my_q.
+
+Scheduler classes
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+It is an extensible hierarchy of scheduler modules. The modules encapsulate
+scheduling policy details. They are called from the core code which is
+independent. Scheduling classes are implemented through the sched_class
+structure. dl_sched_class for deadline scheduler, fair_sched_class for CFS
+and rt_sched_class for RT are implementations of this class.
+
+The important methods of scheduler class are:
+
+enqueue_task and dequeue_task
+    These functions are used to put and remove tasks from the runqueue
+    respectively to change a property of a task. This is referred to as
+    change pattern.  Change is defined as the following sequence of calls::
+
+         * dequeue_task()
+         * put_prev_task()
+         * change a property
+         * enqueue_task()
+         * set_next_task()
+
+    The enqueue_task function takes the runqueue, the task which needs to
+    be enqueued/dequeued and a bit mask of flags as parameters. The main
+    purpose of the flags is to describe why the enqueue or dequeue is being
+    called. The different flags used are described in ::
+
+        kernel/sched/sched.h
+
+    Some places where the enqueue_task and dequeue_task are called for
+    changing task properties are
+
+    * When migrating a task from one CPU's runqueue to another.
+    * When changing a tasks CPU affinity.
+    * When changing the priority of a task.
+    * When changing the nice value of the task.
+    * When changing the scheduling policy and/or RT priority of a thread.
+
+pick_next_task
+    Called by the scheduler to pick the next best task to run. The scheduler
+    iterates through the corresponding functions of the scheduler classes
+    in priority order to pick up the next best task to run. Since tasks
+    belonging to the idle class and fair class are frequent, the scheduler
+    optimizes the picking of next task to call the pick_next_task_fair()
+    if the previous task was of the similar scheduling class.
+
+put_prev_task
+    Called by the scheduler when a running task is being taken off a CPU.
+    The behavior of this function depends on individual scheduling classes.
+    In CFS class this function is used to put the currently running task back
+    into the CFS RB tree. When a task is running it is dequeued from the tree.
+    This is to prevent redundant enqueue's and dequeue's for updating its
+    vruntime. vruntime of tasks on the tree needs to be updated by update_curr()
+    to keep the tree in sync. In SCHED_DEADLINE and RT classes additional tree
+    is maintained to push tasks from the current CPU to another CPU where the
+    task can preempt and start executing. Task will be added to this queue
+    if it is present on the scheduling class rq and the task has affinity
+    to more than one CPU.
+
+set_next_task
+    Pairs with the put_prev_task(), this function is called when the next
+    task is set to run on the CPU. This function is called in all the places
+    where put_prev_task is called to complete the 'change pattern'. In case
+    of CFS scheduling class, it will set current scheduling entity to the
+    picked task and accounts bandwidth usage on the cfs_rq. In addition it
+    will also remove the current entity from the CFS runqueue for the vruntime
+    update optimization, opposite to what was done in put_prev_task.
+    For the SCHED_DEADLINE and RT classes it will remove the task from the
+    tree of pushable tasks trigger the balance callback to push another task
+    which is non running on the current CPU for execution on another CPU.
+
+    * dequeue the picked task from the tree of pushable tasks.
+    * update the load average in case the previous task belonged to another
+      class.
+    * queues the function to push tasks from current runqueue to other CPUs
+      which can preempt and start execution. Balance callback list is used.
+
+task_tick
+    Called from scheduler_tick(), hrtick() and sched_tick_remote() to update
+    the current task statistics and load averages. Also restarting the high
+    resolution tick timer is done if high resolution timers are enabled.
+    scheduler_tick() runs at 1/HZ and is called from the timer interrupt
+    handler of the Kernel internal timers.
+    hrtick() is called from high resolution timers to deliver an accurate
+    preemption tick as the regular scheduler tick that runs at 1/HZ can be
+    too coarse when nice levels are used.
+    sched_tick_remote() gets called by the offloaded residual 1Hz scheduler
+    tick. In order to reduce interruptions to bare metal tasks, it is possible
+    to outsource these scheduler ticks to the global workqueue so that a
+    housekeeping CPU handles those remotely.
+
+select_task_rq
+    Called by scheduler to get the CPU to assign a task to and migrating
+    tasks between CPUs. Flags describe the reason the function was called.
+    Called by try_to_wake_up() with SD_BALANCE_WAKE flag which wakes up a
+    sleeping task.
+    Called by wake_up_new_task() with SD_BALANCE_FORK flag which wakes up a
+    newly forked task.
+    Called by sched_exec() with SD_BALANCE_EXEC which is called from execv
+    syscall.
+    SCHED_DEADLINE class decides the CPU on which the task should be woken
+    up based on the deadline. RT class decides based on the RT priority. Fair
+    scheduling class balances load by selecting the idlest CPU in the
+    idlest group, or under certain conditions an idle sibling CPU if the
+    domain has SD_WAKE_AFFINE set.
+
+balance
+    Called by pick_next_task() from scheduler to enable scheduling classes
+    to pull tasks from runqueues of other CPUs for balancing task execution
+    between the CPUs.
+
+task_fork
+    Called from sched_fork() of scheduler which assigns a task to a CPU.
+    Fair scheduling class updates runqueue clock, runtime statistics and
+    vruntime for the scheduling entity.
+
+yield_task
+    Called from SYSCALL sched_yield to yield the CPU to other tasks.
+    SCHED_DEADLINE class forces the runtime of the task to zero using a special
+    flag and dequeues the task from its trees. RT class requeues the task
+    entities to the end of the run list. Fair scheduling class implements
+    the buddy mechanism. This allows skipping onto the next highest priority
+    scheduling entity at every level in the CFS tree, unless doing so would
+    introduce gross unfairness in CPU time distribution.
+
+check_preempt_curr
+    Check whether the task that woke up should preempt the currently
+    running task. Called by scheduler,
+
+    * when moving queued task to new runqueue
+    * ttwu()
+    * when waking up newly created task for the first time.
+
+    SCHED_DEADLINE class compares the deadlines of the tasks and calls
+    scheduler function resched_curr() if the preemption is needed. In case
+    the deadlines are equal, migratability of the tasks is used a criteria
+    for preemption.
+    RT class behaves the same except it uses RT priority for comparison.
+    Fair class sets the buddy hints before calling resched_curr() to preempt.
+
+Scheduler sets the scheduler class for each task based on its priority.
+Tasks assigned with SCHED_NORMAL, SCHED_IDLE and SCHED_BATCH call
+fair_sched_class hooks and tasks assigned with SCHED_RR and
+SCHED_FIFO call rt_sched_class hooks. Tasks assigned with SCHED_DEADLINE
+policy calls dl_sched_class hooks.
