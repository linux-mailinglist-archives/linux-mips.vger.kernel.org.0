I actually already did in response to the last part of your previous
message. You must have missed it. Here is the copy of the message:

Could you also answer to my question above regarding using the
sparsemem instead on my hw memory layout?

Absolutely right. Please see my messages above.

Right. That's what currently happens on MIPS32 and that's what I had
to fix in the framework of this series by the next patch:
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mips/20231122182419.30633-4-fancer.lancer@gmail.com/
flatmem version of the pfn_valid() method has been broken due to
max_mapnr being uninitialized before mem_init() is called. So
init_unavailable_range() didn't initialize the pages on the early
bootup stage. Thus afterwards, when max_mapnr has finally got a valid
value any attempts to call the __update_cache() method on the MMIO
memory hole caused the unaligned access crash.

Ok. I'll resend the patch with mentioning flatmem holes instead of
mentioning the IO-spaces.

Ah, I see. In case of the SPARSEMEM config an another version of
pfn_valid() will be called. It's defined in the include/linux/mmzone.h
header file. Right? If so then no problem there indeed.
