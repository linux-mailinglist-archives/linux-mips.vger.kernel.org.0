Yes hardware is different. But software is same and fully backward
compatible. And base part of config space is same for both PCI an PCIe.
So it is possible to copy+paste HDL code which fills initial values into
config space from old PCI IPs to new PCIe IPs.

In kernel there is quirk only for one device with id:
PCI_VENDOR_ID_MARVELL (0x11ab) PCI_DEVICE_ID_MARVELL_GT64111 (0x4146)

So for some reasons quirk is needed... Anyway, patch for this quirk just
adds comment as there is no explanation for it. It does not modify quirk
code.

So it is possible that Marvell (or rather Galileo at that time) included
some config space fixup in some products and 0x4146 did not have it.
Just guessing... We can really only guess what could happen at that time
20 years ago...

Running git blame told me that this class code quirk was introduce in:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c4ed38a0c6e2e5c4906296758f816ee71373792f

But there is also no information...

This is 11ab:4620 device an there is no PCIe capability in its config
space (you can inspect it via 'lspci -F dump.txt -nn -vv' but there is
nothing interesting).
