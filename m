"shared_fifo_flush" is pretty much self-explanatory though. It then=20
becomes obvious looking at the code that when this flag is set, TFLUSH=20
flushes both FIFOs.

If you prefer... you can #define JZ_AIC_CTRL_FLUSH JZ_AIC_CTRL_TFLUSH.=20
I don't like the JZ4760 prefix, this is in no way specific to the=20
JZ4760.

Ok. It makes sense then. Please add some info about this in the commit=20
message, because it really wasn't obvious to me.

You should maybe factorize the read-modify-write into its own function.=20
I know this gets eventually modified by [03/11], but this [01/11] is a=20
bugfix so it will be applied to older kernels, and I'd rather not have=20
duplicated code there.

Cheers,
