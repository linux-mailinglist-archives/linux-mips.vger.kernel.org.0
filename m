I'd like to clean up the 'drivers' directory and Kconfig menu, at least
a little. One major thing I noticed is that VLYNQ can actually be
removed. From patch 2:

---
There are no users with a vlynq_driver in the Kernel tree. So, remove
the bus driver which hardly has seen any activity since 2009. It was
even marked EXPERIMENTAL as long as that symbol existed. OpenWRT had
some out-of-tree drivers which they probably intended to upport, but AR7
devices are not supported anymore because they are "stuck with Kernel
3.18" [1]. So, this code can go nowadays.

[1] https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/targets/ar7
---

Patch 1 removes MIPS specific bus initialization code which is the only
user of the VLYNQ bus currently.

Sending out as RFC to gather comments. Patches are based on 6.6-rc1 and
created with "--irreversible-delete" to save some space. They are
compile tested only, buildbots were happy.

I think this mainly goes to Florian Fainelli. Florian, what do you
think?

All the best!
