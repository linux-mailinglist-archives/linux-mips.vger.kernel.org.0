I wouldn't say there aren't much users. ioremap_wc() and it's
devm-version is widely utilized in the GPU and network and some other
subsystems. ioremap_cache() isn't widespread indeed. In anyway even a
single user must be supported in safely calling the method if it's
provided by the arch-code, otherwise the method could be considered as
just a bogus stub to have the kernel successfully built. I bet you'll
agree with that. But that's not the point in this case.

A bit later you also noted:

Right. Thanks. To be honest I haven't noticed that before your
message. _page_cachable_default is indeed initialized in the
cpu_cache_init() method, several steps after it would be used in the
framework of dmi_remap_early(). On the other hand ioremap_cache() is
defined as ioremap_prot() with the _page_cachable_default variable
passed. So my code will still correctly work unless
_page_cachable_default is pre-initialized with something other than
zero. On the other hand we can't easily change its default value
because it will affect and likely break the r3k (CPU_R3000) and Octeon
based platforms, because it's utilized to initialize the
protection-map table. Of course we can fix the r3k_cache_init() and
octeon_cache_init() methods too so they would get the
_page_cachable_default variable back to zero, but it will also make
things around it more complicated.

Also note, moving the _page_cachable_default initialization to the
earlier stages like cpu_probe() won't work better because the field
value may get change for instance in the framework of the smp_setup()
function (see cps_smp_setup()).

So after all the considerations above this solution now looks even
clumsier than before.( Any idea how to make it better?

Note the memory might be clobbered even before dmi_setup() for
instance by means of the early_memtest() method. In anyway it would be
better if the system booloader would have already reserved the DMI
memory (in DTB) or it would have been done by the platform-specific
plat_mem_setup() method.

Which quirks do you mean to be dependent in between the current
dmi_setup() call place and the cpu_cache_init() method invocation?
