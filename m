Why do you need to check this?  If you have a parent, it's your node
should be set, if not, that's an error, right?

Who set that bus->bridge node to NUMA_NO_NODE?
If that is set, the firmware is broken, as you say, but you need to tell
the user what firmware is broken.

Try something like this out and see what happens on your machine that
had things "broken".  What does it say?

That should be true, yes.

Good luck, I don't really think that most, if any, of this is needed,
but hey, it's nice to clean it up where it can be :)
