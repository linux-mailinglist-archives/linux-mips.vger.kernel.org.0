We "can't", but we "can", right? Userspace can freely unbind a driver.
Unless you want to dig into if the community would allow a driver to
block "unbind" then we have to, at the very least, not crash the
kernel when userspace does this. Ideally we'd have something more
elegant than just "don't crash the kernel", but at least we shouldn't
crash.

Right. I think my original point was looking at "ingenic-drm-drv.c".
Much of the "devm" stuff there is resources and those specific things
could be moved to probe() instead of bind(), right?

For allocations, I think you'd have to look at each allocation. If the
allocation needed to live as long as the "struct drm_device" then devm
is clearly the wrong choice. ...but not every allocation needs to live
that long. Also, even if in the "simple" case allocations need to live
as long as a "struct drm_device", it's possible that there are some
cases where there's only an indirect reference to the memory. In that
case, you could NULL out the indirect reference and then free it.
Obviously someone would need to take care here.

So I think here is where the disconnect is from our viewpoints. IMO
when a Linux driver is unbound then it makes no sense to try to
operate the device in "a degraded mode". When a Linux driver is
unbound then it should be releasing all of the resources from the
device (iomaps, IRQs, regulators, GPIOs, etc). That's just what
unbinding a driver is supposed to do.

I understand what you're saying above about display pipelines being
multiple Linux drivers working together and that it doesn't make lots
of sense to just unbind a random Linux device driver in the middle of
things. ...and I don't really have a simple/great answer for how to do
something super elegant if userspace tries to just randomly unbind one
of the many drivers in an active display pipeline.

I guess I would have expected that the remove() callback in the device
would prevent new commits from starting and then block waiting until
any in-progress commits were finished? ...kinda like how drivers call
del_timer_sync() in their remove functions...

I'm fairly certain that you can prevent a module from being unloaded
by just grabbing a refcount to it. However, I'm not sure that's the
right solution. If we're trying to run driver code after a driver has
been unbound then, IMO, that's the bug.

I'm mostly just saying don't just search-and-replace "devm" with
"drmm" in your driver and call it done. You need to think carefully
about which things are which lifetime.

---

Ironically, while digging into this I'm tempted to take back my
original request. Despite the kernel docs I pointed at [1], it
actually looks like it might be fine to use "devm" within a
component's bind() function. In try_to_bring_up_aggregate_device() it
seems like the code is opening up a nested "devres" group specifically
to allow this to work. A little bit of testing that I did with this
shows that, indeed, the nesting seems to be working. Am I missing
something here?
