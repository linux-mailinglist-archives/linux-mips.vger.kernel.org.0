So...

Last week I decided to study a bit how AVIC behaves when vCPUs are not 100% running
(aka no cpu_pm=on), to mostly understand their so-called 'GA log' thing.
 
(This thing is that when you tell the IOMMU that a vCPU is not running,
the IOMMU starts logging all incoming passed-through interrupts to a ring buffer,
and raises its own interrupt, whichâ€™s handler is supposed to wake up the VM's vCPU.)
 
That led to me discovering that AMD's IOMMU is totally busted after a suspend/resume cycle,
fixing which took me few days (and most of the time I worried that it's some sort of a BIOS bug which nobody would fix,
as the IOMMU interrupt delivery was totally busted after resume, sometimes even power cycle didn't help
to revive it - phew...). 
Luckily I did fix it, and patches are waiting for the review upstream.
(https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg4153488.html)
 
 
Another thing I discovered that this patch series totally breaks my VMs, without cpu_pm=on
The whole series (I didn't yet bisect it) makes even my fedora32 VM be very laggy, almost unusable,
and it only has one passed-through device, a nic).
 
If I apply though only the patch series up to this patch, my fedora VM seems to work fine, but
my windows VM still locks up hard when I run 'LatencyTop' in it, which doesn't happen without this patch.
 
 
So far the symptoms I see is that on VCPU 0, ISR has quite high interrupt (0xe1 last time I seen it),
TPR and PPR are 0xe0 (although I have seen TPR to have different values), and IRR has plenty of interrupts
with lower priority. The VM seems to be stuck in this case. As if its EOI got lost or something is preventing
the IRQ handler from issuing EOI.
 
LatencyTop does install some form of a kernel driver which likely does meddle with interrupts (maybe it sends lots of self IPIs?).
 
100% reproducible as soon as I start monitoring with LatencyTop.
 
 
Without this patch it works (or if disabling halt polling),
 
but I still did manage to lockup the VM few times still, after lot of random clicking/starting up various apps while LatencyTop was running,
etc, but in this case when I dump local apic via qemu's hmp interface the VM instantly revives, which might be either same bug
which got amplified by this patch or something else.
That was tested on the pure 5.15.0 kernel without any patches.
 
It is possible that this is a bug in LatencyTop that just got exposed by different timing.
 
The windows VM does have GPU and few USB controllers passed to it, and without them, in pure VM mode, as I call it,
the LatencyTop seems to work.
 

Tomorrow I'll give it a more formal investigation.
