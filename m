That's really a different thing, but frankly that panic is also bogus 
anyway - there is no good reason to have different behaviour for failing 
to allocate a buffer slot because the buffer is full vs. failing to 
allocate a buffer slot because there is no buffer. If we can fail 
gracefully some of the time we should fail gracefully all of the time. 
Yes, there's a slight difference in that one case has a chance of 
succeeding if retried in future while the other definitely doesn't, but 
it's not SWIOTLB's place to decide that the entire system is terminally 
unusable just because some device can't make a DMA mapping.

Similarly for the other panics at init time, which seem to have 
originated from a mechanical refactoring of the memblock API with the 
expectation of preserving the existing behaviour at the time. Those have 
then just been moved around without anyone thinking to question why 
they're there, and if memblock *does* now return usable error 
information, why don't we start handling that error properly like we do 
in other init paths?

Really there is no reason to panic anywhere in SWIOTLB. This is old 
code, things have moved on over the last 20 years, and we can and should 
do much better. I'll add this to my list of things to look at for 
cleanup once I find a bit of free time, unless anyone else fancies 
taking it on.

Thanks,
Robin.
