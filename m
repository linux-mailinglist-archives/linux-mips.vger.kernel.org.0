Nit: While at it, it would be nice to rename this to pi_wakeup_hanlder() so that it can be more easilly
found.

s/interrupted/interrupt ?

Isn't that comment incorrect? As I see, the PI hardware is setup to use the WAKEUP_VECTOR
when vcpu blocks (in pi_pre_block) and then that vcpu is added to the list.
The pi_wakeup_hanlder just goes over the list and wakes up all vcpus on the lsit.

Also while at it, why not to rename this to 'blocked_vcpu_list'?
to explain that this is list of blocked vcpus. Its a per-cpu variable
so 'on_cpu' suffix isn't needed IMHO.

It would be nice to have a function for this, this appears in this file twice.
Maybe there is a function already somewhere?
