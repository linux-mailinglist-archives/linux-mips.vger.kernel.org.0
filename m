Huacai,

I do support and salute the series (as I always did), as I see it as a
giant step forward for KVM for MIPS.

However, in general, I think any series should not depend on "pick
that patch from another tree", and should be a stand-alone unit that
yields to successful build and desired functionality. If there is a
dependency like you described, the patch in question, in my opinion,
should be integrated into the series in question. Git is even smart
enough that it recognizes the same patch has been applied before, so
integration of another tree would not be exposed to problems.

From the point of view of synchronizing with QEMU part, and the timing
issues wrt kernel and QEMU releases, I want to stress that it is
better that this series is integrated sooner rather than later. In
other words, I think that potential Paolo's KVM pull request should
happen before Thomas' mips-next pull request (Paolo could include
"mips: define pud_index() regardless of page table folding", and
Thomas could simply omit it).

But, that said, I don't feel I should impose my opinion to others
here. Take my statements just as advises. I defer the decision on how
to proceed with the integration of this series entirely to Paolo and
Thomas.

Yours,
Aleksandar
