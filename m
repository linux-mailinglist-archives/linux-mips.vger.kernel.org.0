Hello My Beloved One, i need your assistance,

Please bear with me i am writing this mail to you with tears and
sorrow from my heart.

I am Aisha Muammar Gaddafi, the only daughter of the embattled
president of Libya, Hon. Muammar Gaddafi. I know my mail might come to
you as a surprise because you don=E2=80=99t know me, but due to unsolicited
nature of my situation here in Refugee camp, i decided to contact you
for help. I have passed through pains and sorrowful moment since the
death of my father. my family is the target of Western nations who
wants to destroy my father at all costs. Our investments and bank
accounts in several countries are their targets to freeze.

My Father of blessed memory deposited the sum of $15.8M (fifteen
Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars) at the bank in Burkina Faso
which he used my name as the next of kin. I have been commissioned by
the bank to present an interested foreign investor/partner who can
stand as my trustee and receive the fund in his account for a possible
investment in his country due to my status here.

I am in search of an honest and reliable person who will help me  and
stand as my trustee so that I will present him to the Bank for the
transfer of the fund to his bank account overseas. I have chosen to
contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray my
trust but rather take me as your own sister or daughter. If this
transaction interest you, you don't have to disclose it to any body
because of what is going with my entire family, if the united nation
happens to know this account, they will freezing it as they freeze
others, so please keep this transaction only to yourself until we
finalize it.

me when i hear from you. Do not reply if you are not interested,
delete from your inbox. thanks

Yours Sincerely
Best Regard,
