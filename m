I assume. Nobody has reported an issue without having any specific =
jz4780 driver in place.
Well, that is only evidence, not bullet proof.

The compatible ingenic,jz4780-otg was introduced in =
158c774d3c64859e84dd20e04d5fb18c8d3d318e.
Hence I have added Yanjie for clarification why he added it in the .dts =
and not in the bindings.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
