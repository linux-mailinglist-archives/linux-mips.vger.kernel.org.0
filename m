AFAIK, ftpm and tee_bnxt_fw drivers only support OP-TEE at this point.
See ftpm_tee_match() and optee_ctx_match() APIs in corresponding
drivers.

Yes, that's what I meant earlier to make the TEE_SHM_DMA_BUF flag optional.

I don't think that would make any difference.

AFAIK, its due the the inherent nature of tee_shm_alloc() and
tee_shm_register() where tee_shm_alloc() doesn't need to know whether
its a kernel or user-space memory since it is the one that allocates
whereas tee_shm_register() need to know that since it has to register
pre-allocated client memory.

Yeah, but do we have platforms in OP-TEE that don't support dynamic
shared memory? I guess it has become the sane default which is a
mandatory requirement when it comes to OP-TEE driver in u-boot.

I would like you to go through Section "3.2.4. Shared Memory" in TEE
Client API Specification. There are two standard ways for shared
memory approach with TEE:

1. A Shared Memory block can either be existing Client Application
memory (kernel driver in our case) which is subsequently registered
with the TEE Client API (using tee_shm_register() in our case).

2. Or memory which is allocated on behalf of the Client Application
using the TEE
Client API (using tee_shm_alloc() in our case).

From drivers perspective I think the change should be:

tee_shm_alloc()

to

kcalloc()
tee_shm_register()
