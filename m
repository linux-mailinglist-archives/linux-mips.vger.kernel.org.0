 I saw that, but this is irrelevant.  Dropping a keyboard event won't make 
the system unstable (though it can make a console user unstable, out of 
irritation).

 Thanks, that indeed helps, though indirectly.  I think the most relevant, 
though still terse explanation comes from commit 20c0d2d44029 ("[PATCH] 
i386: pass proper trap numbers to die chain handlers"), which I believe is 
the earliest of similar changes.  The patch was originally submitted here: 
<https://lore.kernel.org/r/43DDF02E.76F0.0078.0@novell.com/> and hardly 
any discussion emerged, but I think the key statement is:

"[...] honor the return value from the handler chain invocation in die() 
as, through a debugger, the fault may have been fixed."

Now it makes sense to me: even if ignoring the event will make the system 
unstable, by allowing access through a debugger it has been compromised 
already anyway.

 So I think your change will be good if you update the change description 
to include the justification quoted above rather than just: "the others do 
it too, so it must be good" (though you can of course mention that your 
change also makes our port consistent with other ones).  I suggest linking 
to the original i386 submission too for future reference.

 Also I note that you combine three independent changes into one, so 
please split it into individual patches as per our requirements.
