Well, how can you as a reviewer see immediately that dtbscheck
warns for both instances and that they are both really fixed by the
complete patch?

Assume there were only the first one mentioned and the second one
forgotten to fix...

If it is not included here (completely), you have to run dtbscheck=20
yourself to see that there are two instances involved. Or deduce it
from looking into the source file.

In both cases much more work for you or other reviewers.

This is why I have kept this redundancy. One commit hunk for every
warning line.

And it may only look redundant in the commit message, not in code=20
where it would really hurt to have duplication.

It has of course been tested on real hardware.
There was only one case where the bindings seem to be wrong (patch =
13/18).

And usually I simply assume such generic bindings are tested on many
other platforms and therefore the reference. What are bindings and
dtbscheck good for if we doubt them as DTS developers?

Every patch of this series has been tested on real hardware to have
no negative side-effects.
