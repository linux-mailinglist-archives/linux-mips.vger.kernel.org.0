Yes, someday this may be true.  Allowing guest_memfd (it was probably calle=
d
something else at that point) for "regular" memory was discussed in I think=
 v10?
We made a concious decision to defer supporting 2 guest_memfds because it i=
sn't strictly
necessary to support the TDX/SNP use cases for which all of this was initia=
lly
designed, and adding a second guest_memfd and the infrastructure needed to =
let
userspace map a guest_memfd can be done on top with minimal overhead.

Making the private vs. shared state a property of the guest_memfd doesn't w=
ork
for TDX and SNP.  We (upstream x86 and KVM maintainers) have taken a hard s=
tance
that in-place conversion will not be allowed for TDX/SNP due to the ease wi=
th
which a misbehaving userspace and/or guest can crash the host.

We'd also be betting that there would *never* be a use case for per-gfn att=
ributes
for non-standard memory, e.g. virtio-gpu buffers, any kind of device memory=
, etc.

We'd also effectively be signing up to either support swap and page migrati=
on in
guest_memfd, or make those mutually exclusive with per-gfn attributes too.

guest_memfd is only intended for guest DRAM, and if I get my way, will neve=
r support
swap (page migration is less scary).  I.e. guest_memfd isn't intended to be=
 a
one-size-fits-all solution, nor is it intended to wholesale replace memslot=
s,
which is effectively what we'd be doing by deprecating hva-based guest memo=
ry.

And ignoring all that, the ABI would end up being rather bizarre due to way=
 guest_memfd
interacts with memslots.  guest_memfd itself has no real notion of gfns, i.=
e. the
shared vs. private state would be tied to a file offset, not a gfn.  That's=
 a solvable
problem, e.g. we could make a gfn:offset binding "sticky", but that would e=
dd extra
complexity to the ABI, and AFAICT wouldn't buy us that much, if anything.

For in-place conversions, e.g. pKVM, no additional guest_memfd is needed.  =
What's
missing there is the ability to (safely) mmap() guest_memfd, e.g. KVM needs=
 to
ensure there are no outstanding references when converting back to private.

For TDX/SNP, assuming we don't find a performant and robust way to do in-pl=
ace
conversions, a second fd+offset pair would be needed.
