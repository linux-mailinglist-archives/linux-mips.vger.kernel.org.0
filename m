You did everything good.

I think the CI20 suffered from the same problem, it would only boot as 
long as the "clk_ignore_unused" flag was added on the command line. I 
will need to try it there to see if it improved the situation.

I tested the patchset on JZ4770 and it works fine. So:

@Stephen: I don't see any changes pending on board-ingenic.c so it 
should be safe for you to also take [PATCH 3/3] in the clk tree.

Cheers,
-Paul
