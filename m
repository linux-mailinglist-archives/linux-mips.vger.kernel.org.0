Thanks for taking a jab at this. At a glance it looks okay, with one
comment below.

FWIW I still intend to write a more pamphlet-sized thing, I'll toss
something out in the coming weeks - depending on where this goes, I might
base it on this.

We don't rebuild domains on frequency changes (that would be ludicrous!),
rather we do that on policy changes. It's mostly because we need to wait
for cpufreq to be loaded before having a complete view over the capacities
of the CPUs (which is a mix of Âµarch and frequencies), i.e. we need to
rebuild the SD's again once cpufreq comes up.
