 Thanks.  I worked with QEMU in the past, up to contributing to the MIPS 
target, so I'm quite familiar with this stuff, but it does require some 
time to set up, which I'd rather use for something else right now.

 Also I'd rather I had the core card repaired or replaced really as the 
preferred solution before resorting to alternatives.  The baseboard seems 
fine and it would be a waste of a valuable resource to just have it lying 
around collecting dust.  I wonder if the problem could be a BGA failure 
(this is a pre-RoHS device, so no issue with early lead-free solder) or an 
actual component fault.
