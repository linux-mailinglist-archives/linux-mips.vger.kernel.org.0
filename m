 The use of RDHWR, actual or emulated, is a part of the MIPS TLS psABI, 
see: <https://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/NPTL>, in particular starting from: 
<https://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/NPTL#Design_Choices> and throughout (the 
expired certificate of the web site is a known issue, but there is 
currently no way to get it fixed as nobody knows where Ralf Baechle has 
gone).

 The macros are there to support different instructions used to access 
data within TLS.  However the TLS pointer still has to be fetched with 
RDHWR, and READ_THREAD_POINTER does exactly that, by calling the 
`__builtin_thread_pointer' intrinsic in the MIPS16 case.  How it works is 
explained in GCC sources, in gcc/config/mips/mips.md:

;; In MIPS16 mode, the TLS base pointer is accessed by a
;; libgcc helper function __mips16_rdhwr(), as 'rdhwr' is not
;; accessible in MIPS16.
;;
;; This is not represented as a call insn, to avoid the
;; unnecesarry clobbering of caller-save registers by a
;; function consisting only of: "rdhwr $3,$29; j $31; nop;"
;;
;; A $25 clobber is added to cater for a $25 load stub added by the
;; linker to __mips16_rdhwr when the call is made from non-PIC code.

-- that is a small piece of regular MIPS code is called, which executes 
RDHWR.

 Where exactly do you see a problem, what are the symptoms?  A bug in the 
emulation cannot be ruled out of course.

 While there indeed is an unfortunate opcode overlap between RDHWR and SQ, 
the encoding of the specific operands chosen for TLS pointer access is 
luckily guaranteed to always trap in the user mode, because the address 
requested when the encoding is interpreted as SQ rather than RDHWR is 
within the kernel KSEG2 segment:

$ cat rdhwr.s
	rdhwr	$3, $29
$ gcc -march=mips32r2 -c rdhwr.s
$ objdump -d rdhwr.o
rdhwr.o:     file format elf32-tradlittlemips


Disassembly of section .text:

00000000 <.text>:
   0:	7c03e83b 	rdhwr	v1,$29
	...
$ objdump -m mips:5900 -d rdhwr.o

rdhwr.o:     file format elf32-tradlittlemips


Disassembly of section .text:

00000000 <.text>:
   0:	7c03e83b 	sq	v1,-6085(zero)
	...
$ 

This is because the HWR read is encoded in bits 15:11 of the instruction 
word and $29 has the highest bit set, which lands in bit 15 of the 
instruction word, meaning that the offset encoded in bits 15:0 used where 
the instruction word is interpreted as SQ is negative.  And then bits 
25:21 are hardwired to 0 in the encoding of RDHWR and they correspond to 
the base register encoding with SQ, meaning that it will be interpreted as 
$zero.  So the address ultimately requested is -6085 => 0xffffffffffffe83b 
(the R5900 uses 32-bit addressing and ignores address bits 63:32, but that 
does not matter here; this is KSEG2 either way).

 Consequently an AdES exception is triggered which we can trap and handle, 
reinterpreting the encoding according to our needs and return the TLS 
pointer in $v1 rather than issuing a SIGBUS.  So you are not expected to 
see any issue unless there is a security erratum in the R5900 as well and 
the encoding does not cause an exception for some reason.

 This of course disagrees with what Fredrik wrote in the quotation above, 
as it's the last page rather than the zeroth that is accessed, but the net 
effect is the same, or even better.
