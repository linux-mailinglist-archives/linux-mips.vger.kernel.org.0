Because the filesystem is deprecated and rarely used. Those who do use Reis=
erFS
should migrate away from it or get ready to stop upgrading their kernels so=
on.

This removal from defconfig:

 1) Serves as a reminder to those that use the fs that they should take the
    above actions, but with the filesystem staying available should they ne=
ed
    it.

 2) Stops building an obsolete and largely-unused filesystem unnecessarily.
    Some hobbyist targets like m68k and alpha may prefer to keep all filesy=
stems
    available until total removal, but others like arm and UML have no need=
 for
    ReiserFS to be built unless specifically configured.

 3) Arguably simplifies the removal of the filesystem when that takes place=
.
    This point is admittedly quite weak.

 4) Has to happen someday, unless someone steps up and volunteers to mainta=
in
    the fs. I don't find it worthwhile, but you can if you'd like. Perhaps =
work
    towards removal will cause a user to step forward and keep their belove=
d
    filesystem around?

 5) Doesn't actually remove support for the filesystem whatsoever. I can't
    emphasize this enough: users who build their own kernel and maintain a
    niche filesystem like ReiserFS should know how to flip a Kconfig switch=
.
