What a fantastically welcome piece of work!  Thanks for doing this,
many's the time I waded through all those calls to ensure a patch was
doing the right thing.

Modulo the nit in patch 42, the arm64 changes survive a guest boot +
hackbench and build fine.  The lack of changing the arm-specific destroy
function to a void also causes a series of warnings for a 32-bit arm
build, but otherwise builds fine.

You can add my:

To the arm/arm64 and generic parts.


Thanks,

    Christoffer
