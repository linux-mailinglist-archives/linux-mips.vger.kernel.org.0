I think you could start on Jiaxun series but the one merged in my
series, because I already had a few fixes for it.

I do not oppose the addition of a new platform, even though, like
Jiaxun, I would prefer to avoid duplicating code. The only thing
preventing the use of the same kernel for EyeQ5 and other platforms is
the starting address. Therefore, if it were possible to have a
relocatable kernel, this issue would disappear.

However, while waiting for your feedback on Jiaxun's part, I will
attempt to add a new platform to assess exactly what the implications
are.
