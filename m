 Decades ago I had a patch to handle this with CPU-specific limits, which 
in the end I have not submitted for one reason or another.  I guess we 
didn't have what is `cpu_vmbits' nowadays.  I'll see if I can dig it out 
and check if there's anything interesting there we might also require.

 Overall good work, and I'm rather embarassed we have gone so far without 
it.  Thanks!
