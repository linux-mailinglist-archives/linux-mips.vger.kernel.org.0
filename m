Problem
-------

SoC devices require power-off call chaining functionality from kernel.
We have a widely used restart chaining provided by restart notifier API,
but nothing for power-off.

Solution
--------

Introduce new API that provides call chains support for all restart and
power-off modes. The new API is designed with simplicity and extensibility
in mind.

This is a third attempt to introduce the new API. First was made by
Guenter Roeck back in 2014, second was made by Thierry Reding in 2017.
In fact the work didn't stop and recently arm_pm_restart() was removed
from v5.14 kernel, which was a part of preparatory work started by
Guenter Roeck.

Adoption plan
-------------

This patchset introduces the new API. It also converts multiple drivers
and arch code to the new API to demonstrate how it all looks in practice,
removing the pm_power_off_prepare global variable.

The plan is:

1. Merge the new API and convert arch code to use do_kernel_power_off().
   For now the new API will co-exist with the older API.

2. Convert all drivers and platform code to the new API.

3. Remove obsoleted pm_power_off and pm_power_off_prepare variables.

Results
-------

1. Devices can be powered off properly.

2. Global variables are removed from drivers.

3. Global pm_power_off and pm_power_off_prepare callback variables are
removed once all users are converted to the new API. The latter callback
is removed by patch #24 of this series.

4. Ambiguous call chain ordering is prohibited for non-default priorities.

Changelog:

v8: - Reworked sys-off handler like was suggested by Rafael Wysocki in
      the comments to v7.

    - The struct sys-off handler now is private to kernel/reboot.c and
      new API is simplified.

    - There is a single sys-off API function for all handler types.
      Users shall pass the required sys-off mode type (restart, power-off
      and etc).

    - There is single struct sys_off_data callback argument for all
      handler modes.

    - User's callback now must return NOTIFY_DONE or NOTIFY_STOP.

    - The default priority level is zero now.

    - Multiple handlers now allowed to be registered at the default
      priority level.

    - Power-off call chain is atomic now, like the restart chain.

    - kernel/reboot.c changes are split up into several logical patches.

    - Added r-b from Michał Mirosław to unmodified patches from v7.

    - Added acks that were missing in v7 by accident.

v7: - Rebased on a recent linux-next. Dropped the recently removed
      NDS32 architecture. Only SH and x86 arches left un-acked.

    - Added acks from Thomas Bogendoerfer and Krzysztof Kozlowski
      to the MIPS and memory/emif patches respectively.

    - Made couple minor cosmetic improvements to the new API.

    - A month ago I joined Collabora and continuing to work on this series
      on the company's time, so changed my email address to collabora.com

v6: - Rebased on a recent linux-next.

    - Made minor couple cosmetic changes.

v5: - Dropped patches which cleaned up notifier/reboot headers, as was
      requested by Rafael Wysocki.

    - Dropped WARN_ON() from the code, as was requested by Rafael Wysocki.
      Replaced it with pr_err() appropriately.

    - Dropped *_notifier_has_unique_priority() functions and added
      *_notifier_chain_register_unique_prio() instead, as was suggested
      by Michał Mirosław and Rafael Wysocki.

    - Dropped export of blocking_notifier_call_chain_is_empty() symbol,
      as was suggested by Rafael Wysocki.

    - Michał Mirosław suggested that will be better to split up patch
      that adds the new API to ease reviewing, but Rafael Wysocki asked
      not add more patches, so I kept it as a single patch.

    - Added temporary "weak" stub for pm_power_off() which fixes linkage
      failure once symbol is removed from arch/* code. Previously I missed
      this problem because was only compile-testing object files.

v4: - Made a very minor improvement to doc comments, clarifying couple
      default values.

    - Corrected list of emails recipient by adding Linus, Sebastian,
      Philipp and more NDS people. Removed bouncing emails.

    - Added acks that were given to v3.

v3: - Renamed power_handler to sys_off_handler as was suggested by
      Rafael Wysocki.

    - Improved doc-comments as was suggested by Rafael Wysocki. Added more
      doc-comments.

    - Implemented full set of 180 patches which convert whole kernel in
      accordance to the plan, see link [1] above. Slightly adjusted API to
      better suit for the remaining converted drivers.

      * Added unregister_sys_off_handler() that is handy for a couple old
        platform drivers.

      * Dropped devm_register_trivial_restart_handler(), 'simple' variant
        is enough to have.

    - Improved "Add atomic/blocking_notifier_has_unique_priority()" patch,
      as was suggested by Andy Shevchenko. Also replaced down_write() with
      down_read() and factored out common notifier_has_unique_priority().

    - Added stop_chain field to struct restart_data and reboot_prep_data
      after discovering couple drivers wanting that feature.

    - Added acks that were given to v2.

v2: - Replaced standalone power-off call chain demo-API with the combined
      power-off+restart API because this is what drivers want. It's a more
      comprehensive solution.

    - Converted multiple drivers and arch code to the new API. Suggested by
      Andy Shevchenko. I skimmed through the rest of drivers, verifying that
      new API suits them. The rest of the drivers will be converted once we
      will settle on the new API, otherwise will be too many patches here.

    - v2 API doesn't expose notifier to users and require handlers to
      have unique priority. Suggested by Guenter Roeck.

    - v2 API has power-off chaining disabled by default and require
      drivers to explicitly opt-in to the chaining. This preserves old
      behaviour for existing drivers once they are converted to the new
      API.
