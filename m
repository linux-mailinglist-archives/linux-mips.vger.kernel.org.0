Ah, good catch.

Doh, yes.  This patch is predicting the future.  The comment becomes correct as of 

  KVM: VMX: Handle PI wakeup shenanigans during vcpu_put/load

but as of this patch the "scheduled out" piece doesn't hold true.

As you noted, addressed in a future patch.

The second instance does go away by the aforementioned:

  KVM: VMX: Handle PI wakeup shenanigans during vcpu_put/load

I'm inclined to say we don't want a helper because there should only ever be one
path that changes PI.ndst.  But a comment would definitely help to explain the
difference between xAPIC and x2APIC IDs.
