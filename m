I had a look and the code is really, really MIPS specific, actually
I would be interested in understanding how many platforms it supports,
it is not even FW configurable.

To give another piece of evidence why some PCI driver code is still in
arch code, look at arch/arm, we did not move it to
drivers/pci/controller for the same reasons, eg lack of DT support.

With hard-coded resources, <asm/...> includes in driver code and MIPS
specific kludges even if it does reuse some APIs shared with controller
drivers I am not 100% certain that moving it to drivers/pci/controller
buys us anything, this is really arch specific code, however we slice
it.

The line between what stays in arch and what goes to
drivers/pci/controller is thin but this code is definitely more on the
arch side IMHO.

I do not question Thomas' effort, which I appreciate, I question
the end result and its usefulness, this series is even increasing
lines of kernel code, I would like to see the benefits.
