Well, again, my assumption is that bindings and .yaml files formally =
describe the actual
hardware components. And they have been reviewed.

So they have a higher level of authority than any current driver or .dts =
implementation.
Unless there is evidence that the bindings are wrong.

I.e. if the bindings feel right why is there a need to argue for that?

It is like test-driven development model. There you have to write code =
that passes
the tests. Not argue against the tests.

BR and thanks,
