flush_tlb_batched_pending() looks like the critical path for this issue then the code
above can mitigate this.

I cannot reproduce this on a 2P 128C Kunpeng920 server. The kernel is based on the
v5.19-rc6 and unixbench of version 5.1.3. The result of `./Run -c 128 -i 1 shell1` is:
      iter-1      iter-2     iter-3
w/o  17708.1     17637.1    17630.1
w    17766.0     17752.3    17861.7

And flush_tlb_batched_pending()isn't the hot spot with the patch:
   7.00%  sh        [kernel.kallsyms]      [k] ptep_clear_flush
   4.17%  sh        [kernel.kallsyms]      [k] ptep_set_access_flags
   2.43%  multi.sh  [kernel.kallsyms]      [k] ptep_clear_flush
   1.98%  sh        [kernel.kallsyms]      [k] _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore
   1.69%  sh        [kernel.kallsyms]      [k] next_uptodate_page
   1.66%  sort      [kernel.kallsyms]      [k] ptep_clear_flush
   1.56%  multi.sh  [kernel.kallsyms]      [k] ptep_set_access_flags
   1.27%  sh        [kernel.kallsyms]      [k] page_counter_cancel
   1.11%  sh        [kernel.kallsyms]      [k] page_remove_rmap
   1.06%  sh        [kernel.kallsyms]      [k] perf_event_alloc

Hi Xin Hao,

I'm not sure the test setup as well as the config is same with yours. (96C vs 128C
should not be the reason I think). Did you check that the 5% is a fluctuation or
not? It'll be helpful if more information provided for reproducing this issue.

Thanks.
