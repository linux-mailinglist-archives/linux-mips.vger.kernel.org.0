The R6000/R6000A CPU only ever existed in systems in the late 1980's that
were fairly large, and I don't think there is a complete, working unit out
there that can actually boot up, let alone boot a Linux kernel.  This check
was probably added as a mental exercise following a processor manual or such.

The old linux-mips wiki even says this:
https://www.linux-mips.org/wiki/R6000

"""
The R6000 is an ECL implementation of the MIPS architecture which was
produced by Bipolar Integrated Technology. The R6000 miroprocessor did
introduce the MIPS II instruction set. Its TLB and cache architecture are
different from all other members of the MIPS family. The R6000 did not
deliver the promised performance benefits, and although it saw some use in
Control Data machines, it quickly disappeared from the mainstream market.
"""

A a quick grep of a recent kernel tree shows this one conditional as the
only user, plus the two defines:

# grep -r "PRID_IMP_R6000" *
arch/mips/include/asm/cpu.h:70:#define PRID_IMP_R6000           0x0300
    /* Same as R3000A  */
arch/mips/include/asm/cpu.h:72:#define PRID_IMP_R6000A          0x0600
arch/mips/include/asm/timex.h:94:       else if (likely(imp !=
PRID_IMP_R6000 && imp != PRID_IMP_R6000A))

I'd say it's better to remove the check and simplify the conditional to
eliminate this corner case.  Maybe keep the #defines around for
documentation, but even that may not be necessary for CPUs that likely don't
exist anymore.
