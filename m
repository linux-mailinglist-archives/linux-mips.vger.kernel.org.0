                                 ^^ ^^ ^^
                           Here is class code

So it confirms that PCI Class code is 0580 which is Memory Controller.
And not Host Bridge as it should be.

If I put this hexdump into dump.txt and run 'lspci -F dump.txt -nn' then I see:
00:00.0 Memory controller [0580]: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Device [11ab:4146] (rev 11)

In your output above is "Host bridge" which means that quirk was applied:
00:00.0 Host bridge [0600]: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Device [11ab:4146] (rev 11)

(I guess in 'lspci -nn -vv -b' should be Memory controller as lspci with
'-b' should not see that quirk change)
