Did you try to set up the hw constraint for the integer PERIODS like
below at open?
  snd_pcm_hw_constraint_integer(runtime, SNDRV_PCM_HW_PARAM_PERIODS)

Without this, it'd allow inconsistent buffer/period set up in your
case.

The periods_min usually defines the hardware/software limit of the
interrupt transfer.

OSS layers do the same as the native API via OSS emulation in
sound/core/oss/pcm*.c.

Did you check the debug messages with dyndbg enabled?
