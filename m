[ This is a small incremental revision on top of v5. I'm sending this now
  rather than waiting longer, as I would typically do, since the 5.19 merge
  window is fast approaching. ]

This series extends KVM's Eager Page Splitting to also split huge pages
mapped by the shadow MMU, specifically **nested MMUs**.

For background on Eager Page Splitting, see:
 - Proposal: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/CALzav=dV_U4r1K9oDq4esb4mpBQDQ2ROQ5zH5wV3KpOaZrRW-A@mail.gmail.com/
 - TDP MMU support: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20220119230739.2234394-1-dmatlack@google.com/

Splitting huge pages mapped by the shadow MMU is more complicated than
the TDP MMU, but it is also more important for performance as the shadow
MMU handles huge page write-protection faults under the write lock.  See
the Performance section for more details.

The extra complexity of splitting huge pages mapped by the shadow MMU
comes from a few places:

(1) The shadow MMU has a limit on the number of shadow pages that are
    allowed to be allocated. So, as a policy, Eager Page Splitting
    refuses to split if there are KVM_MIN_FREE_MMU_PAGES or fewer
    pages available.

(2) Huge pages may be mapped by indirect shadow pages which may have access
    permission constraints from the guest (unlike the TDP MMU which is
    ACC_ALL by default).

(3) Splitting a huge page may end up re-using an existing lower level
    shadow page tables. This is unlike the TDP MMU which always allocates
    new shadow page tables when splitting.

(4) When installing the lower level SPTEs, they must be added to the
    rmap which may require allocating additional pte_list_desc structs.

In Google's internal implementation of Eager Page Splitting, we do not
handle cases (3) and (4), and intstead opts to skip splitting entirely
(case 3) or only partially splitting (case 4). This series handles the
additional cases, which requires an additional 4KiB of memory per VM to
store the extra pte_list_desc cache. However it does also avoids the need
for TLB flushes in most cases and allows KVM to split more pages mapped
by shadow paging.

The bulk of this series is just refactoring the existing MMU code in
preparation for splitting, specifically to make it possible to operate
on the MMU outside of a vCPU context.

Motivation
----------

During dirty logging, VMs using the shadow MMU suffer from:

(1) Write-protection faults on huge pages that take the MMU lock to
    unmap the huge page, map a 4KiB page, and update the dirty log.

(2) Non-present faults caused by (1) that take the MMU lock to map in
    the missing page.

(3) Write-protection faults on 4KiB pages that take the MMU lock to
    make the page writable and update the dirty log. [Note: These faults
    only take the MMU lock during shadow paging.]

The lock contention from (1), (2) and (3) can severely degrade
application performance to the point of failure.  Eager page splitting
eliminates (1) by moving the splitting of huge pages off the vCPU
threads onto the thread invoking VM-ioctls to configure dirty logging,
and eliminates (2) by fully splitting each huge page into its
constituent small pages. (3) is still a concern for shadow paging
workloads (e.g. nested virtualization) but is not addressed by this
series.

Splitting in the VM-ioctl thread is useful because it can run in the
background without interrupting vCPU execution. However, it does take
the MMU lock so it may introduce some extra contention if vCPUs are
hammering the MMU lock. This is offset by the fact that eager page
splitting drops the MMU lock after splitting each SPTE if there is any
contention, and the fact that eager page splitting is reducing the MMU
lock contention from (1) and (2) above. Even workloads that only write
to 5% of their memory see massive MMU lock contention reduction during
dirty logging thanks to Eager Page Splitting (see Performance data
below).

A downside of Eager Page Splitting is that it splits all huge pages,
which may include ranges of memory that are never written to by the
guest and thus could theoretically stay huge. Workloads that write to
only a fraction of their memory may see higher TLB miss costs with Eager
Page Splitting enabled. However, that is secondary to the application
failure that otherwise may occur without Eager Page Splitting.

Further work is necessary to improve the TLB miss performance for
read-heavy workoads, such as dirty logging at 2M instead of 4K.

Performance
-----------

To measure the performance impact of Eager Page Splitting I ran
dirty_log_perf_test with support for a new flag, -n, that causes each vCPU
thread to run in L2 instead of L1. This support will be sent out in a
separate series.

To measure the imapct of customer performance, we can look at the time
it takes all vCPUs to dirty memory after dirty logging has been enabled.
Without Eager Page Splitting enabled, such dirtying must take faults to
split huge pages and bottleneck on the MMU lock.

For write-heavy workloads, there is not as much benefit since nested MMUs
still have to take the write-lock when resolving 4K write-protection
faults (case (3) in the Motivation section). But ready-heavy workloads
greatly benefit.

Eager Page Splitting does increase the time it takes to enable dirty
logging when not using initially-all-set, since that's when KVM splits
huge pages. However, this runs in parallel with vCPU execution and drops
the MMU lock whenever there is contention.

Similarly, Eager Page Splitting increases the time it takes to clear the
dirty log for when using initially-all-set. The first time userspace
clears the dirty log, KVM will split huge pages:

             | Config: tdp_mmu=Y, nested, 100% writes initially-all-set |
             | Iteration 1 clear dirty log time                        |
             | ------------------------------------------------------- |

------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |

4            | 0.003817996s               | 0.039574178s               |
8            | 0.007673616s               | 0.079118964s               |
16           | 0.015733003s               | 0.158006697s               |
32           | 0.031728367s               | 0.330793049s               |
64           | 0.108699714s               | 0.891762988s               |

Subsequent calls to clear the dirty log incur almost no additional cost
since KVM can very quickly determine there are no more huge pages to
split via the RMAP. This is unlike the TDP MMU which must re-traverse
the entire page table to check for huge pages.

             | Config: tdp_mmu=Y, nested, 100% writes initially-all-set |
             | Iteration 2 clear dirty log time                        |

Testing
-------

 - Ran all kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests.

 - Booted a 32-bit non-PAE kernel with shadow paging to verify the
   quadrant change.

 - Ran dirty_log_perf_test with support for a new flag, -n, that causes
   each vCPU thread to run in L2 instead of L1. This support will be
   sent out in a separate series.

 - Tested VM live migration with nested MMUs and huge pages. The live
   migration setup consisted of an 8 vCPU 8 GiB VM running on an Intel
   Cascade Lake host and backed by 1GiB HugeTLBFS memory.  The VM was
   running Debian 10.  Inside a VM was a 6 vCPU 4Gib nested VM also
   Debian 10 and backed by 2M HugeTLBFS. Inside the nested VM ran a
   workload that aggressively accessed memory across 6 threads.
   Tracepoints during the migration confirmes eager page splitting
   occurred, both for the direct TDP MMU mappings, and the nested MMU
   mappings.
