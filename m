well, there is more to improve and stuff I don't like in Jaixun series.
For example misusing CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START to force a load address via config
(IMHO it's already a hack for CRASH_DUMP).

As there is your series and Jiaxun series, where should I comment more
detailed ?

things have improved, but I'm still in favor to use a new platform.
And my main point stays. A "generic" kernel compiled for EyeQ5 will
just run on that platform, which doesn't sound generic to me.
