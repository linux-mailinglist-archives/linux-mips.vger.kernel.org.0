So the users of this interface are expected to set priorities relative
to the "standard" levels.  That wasn't clear.

In that case I would leave POWEROFF_PREPARE as is and rename the other
one to POWEROFF_FINAL.  And maybe put them in the reverse order in the
enum definition, because _PREPARE will be done before _FINAL.

I'm not really sure what you mean here.  Can you give an example?

Well, I got confused by the naming.

The "reboot prep" thing really should be a "system is going down"
notification.  Since "sysoff" is already used in the names below, why
not rename it to "sysoff_prepare"?

IMO, it would be better to document it here, because that's where
people will look first, as a rule.

But they come from these users anyway, don't they?

Well, as I said above, I would rename the "reboot" thing to
"sysoff_prepare" covering all of the cases.  And then either "restart"
or "poweroff" would be called after that, depending on the specific
case.

On a slightly related note, I started to wonder about the actual value
provided by struct sys_off_handler.  Namely, the existing "reboot" and
"restart" notifier chains will be used anyway and there are ways to
use them directly.  Also, there will be ways to use the new "poweroff"
chain directly, so struct sys_off_handler appears to be an extra
complication and it is not particularly easier to use than a
combination of "raw" notifiers.

It looks to me that it might be sufficient to have a way to register a
callback for "sysoff_prepare" (aka "reboot") and "restart" and a pair
of callbacks for "poweroff", with a given priority with all of the
necessary internals taken care of by the framework.

Well, to me it is confusing and it doesn't really make the intention clear.

Personally, I'd call it something like "internal_leave_alone" or similar.

I don't really think that making the callback non-void would be a problem.

Precisely.  And so it shouldn't be done in any way.

But the developers need to check whether or not they do the right
thing anyway and so they will need to look at the code here to see
whether or not it is OK to pass 0 and what happens then.  I'm not sure
if I prefer this to the explicit "default".

Or define POWEROFF_PRIO_DEFAULT as 0 and there will be nothing to worry about.
