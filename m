it's MIPS only and used in basically 3 different SGI platforms.

hmm, I thought the idea of having one drivers/pci/controller directory
is to have all of them in one place.

what makes the xgene driver different from the xtalk-bridge driver ? Ok
it used DT, but it's still just for a specific type of SOCs from one
vendor, isn't it ?

the move from arch/mips/pci to drivers/pci/controller increases lines of
code by two lines. The whole patchset adds 155 lines, but also adds
functionality to be able to use the driver with different platforms.

Anyway I can live with not moving to drivers/pci/controller if you don't
like it there.

Thomas.
