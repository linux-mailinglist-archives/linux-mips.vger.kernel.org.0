 Hmm, not all fixes qualify for or indeed are worth backporting and I'd 
expect those that have no stable annotation to remain on trunk only.  I 
have been following this principle with my submissions anyway.

 Indeed I can see a backport to 5.17 has literally just been posted in 
this humongous patch set, but in this case I suspect Greg has just picked 
this up by hand (thanks, Greg!) having seen this discussion (though how he 
manages to escape alive through the flood of messages has been astonishing 
me).
