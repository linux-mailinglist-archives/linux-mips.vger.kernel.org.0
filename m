Then it looks like it must have been broken in the first place.

I failed to find the MIPS UHI spec. The only link google freely
provide is
http://prplfoundation.org/wiki/MIPS_documentation
but it's broken. Could you please share the doc somehow?
Anyway AFAICS from the MIPS arch code it only concerns the dtb pointer
passed to the kernel. Does it really mandate all the data being in KSEG0?

No, it's not. U-boot is executed in kseg0 anyway.

Right. I've found out that for the safety sake the generic version of the
ioremap_prot() has been recently updated not to do any mapping if the
slab hasn't been initialized:
Link: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230515090848.833045-7-bhe@redhat.com/
I'll add a similar fix to the MIPS-version of the ioremap_prop()
method to make sure no early cached remapping is attempted.

Ok. I see. I'll resubmit my series today as is then. Should you need
to have the problem fixed differently, please either re-base your
patch on top of it, or add your explicit comment that you'll have a
better fix so Thomas could be able to consider to postpone this patch
mergein until your fix is ready.
