 Umm, PCIe is so different hardware-wise from PCI I doubt there's any 
chance for errata to be carried across.  Plus the MIPS SysAD bus is so 
different from other CPU buses.  And we're talking 20+ years old Galileo 
devices here.

 None of the Galileo system controllers I came across had the class code 
set incorrectly.

 For the record here's one from a core card used with a Malta (as with 
arch/mips/pci/fixup-malta.c); it has a newer 64120A chip (marked as an 
engineering sample BTW):

The lack of a quirk with a platform does not mean it cannot have a certain 
PCI/e device.

 As I recall various Atlas/Malta core cards had any of the three device 
variants covered by this vendor:device ID and later batches were actually 
indeed marked Marvell rather than Galileo.
