For Kconfig I tend to agree. For DT I see some "bindings" in the staging
tree are being deleted and published as official DT bindings with this
patchset but I believe we still have to keep the compatible string
backward compatibility regardless because there may be firmware out
there using it.

Rob, what's the standard policy that should be used in this case ?

Thanks,
Lorenzo
