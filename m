I've already added Fixes tags to all of my patches. If you are
comfortable with them going to stable, you'd add
'Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org' to them if/when you merge them so that the
stable team will ensure that they're applied.

Note that I'm not the only person that brought up this bug:

 https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/issues/3637

Once I started digging in, I realized that there were more kexec/kdump
bugs and the series grew.

Thanks for holding off. I'll be quick on my revisions so that you don't
have to moth ball your series for too much longer.
