I have tested the change from 'setup_cm_memory_region()' code into
'pcibios_root_bridge_prepare()' just by moving and renaming it from
the PCIe controller code. The function is properly being called.
However, it looks like at that point, windows are not setup yet (no
windows present at all in bridge->windows) so the system is not able
to get the IORESOURCE_MEM resource to set up the IO coherency unit and
the PCI failed to start:

[   16.785359] mt7621-pci 1e140000.pcie: host bridge /pcie@1e140000 ranges:
[   16.798719] mt7621-pci 1e140000.pcie:   No bus range found for
/pcie@1e140000, using [bus 00-ff]
[   16.816248] mt7621-pci 1e140000.pcie:      MEM
0x0060000000..0x006fffffff -> 0x0060000000
[   16.861310] mt7621-pci 1e140000.pcie:       IO
0x001e160000..0x001e16ffff -> 0x0000000000
[   17.179230] mt7621-pci 1e140000.pcie: PCIE0 enabled
[   17.188954] mt7621-pci 1e140000.pcie: PCIE1 enabled
[   17.198678] mt7621-pci 1e140000.pcie: PCIE2 enabled
[   17.208415] Cannot get memory resource
[   17.215884] mt7621-pci 1e140000.pcie: Scanning root bridge failed
[   17.228454] mt7621-pci: probe of 1e140000.pcie failed with error -22

FWIW, when the function is called, I have also tried to set up
hardcoded addresses. Doing that the IO coherency unit was properly set
up and PCI properly worked (expected). So, using this
'pcibios_root_bridge_prepare()' funcion looks like a possible way to
go but we need the addresses properly being passed into the function.
I've also tried to list 'bridge->dma_ranges' and get resources from
there instead of using the not already setup 'bridge->windows'. There
is nothing inside that list also. 'bridge->bus->resources' is also
empty... Am I missing something? I was expecting the bridge passed
around to be the same that was in PCIe controller code, and it seems
it is (I printed the bridge pointer itself in driver code before
calling 'mt7621_pcie_register_host()' and in
'pcibios_root_bridge_prepare()' at the begging of the function and the
pointer is the same) but windows and other stuff are not already
present there...

Thanks in advance for clarification.
