Hi Paul,
sorry to go back here...

DDC power control is working now (and I now understand that a typo in my =
work-in-progress
ci20.dts had switched the DDC SDA to active "1" without powering DDC and =
that may be beyond
what the monitor wanted to see and therefore DDC edid isn't reliable any =
more... Other
HDMI devices are more probably robust).

I have also tested HPD and could make events passed to user-space by =
setting poll_mode.

There is one subtle thing in ingenic-drm-drv I do not yet understand:

It turns out that the line

		ret =3D clk_prepare_enable(priv->lcd_clk);

initializes JZ_REG_LCD_OSDC to 0x00010005 (i.e. printk tells 0x0 =
before).

and writing=20

		regmap_write(priv->map, JZ_REG_LCD_OSDC, =
JZ_LCD_OSDC_OSDEN);

overwrites it with 0x00000001.

This makes the HDMI monitor go/stay black until I write manually 0x5 to
JZ_REG_LCD_OSDC.

This means that JZ_LCD_OSDC_ALPHAEN must be enabled on jz4780 as well.
Hence overwriting with JZ_LCD_OSDC_OSDEN breaks it.

I didn't notice before because my test setup had some additional private =
patches
+ reverts and it did not properly revert to regmap_write.

Now the questions:
a) 0x5 is understandable that it sets JZ_LCD_OSDC_ALPHAEN - but why is =
it needed?
   Is this a not well documented difference between jz4740/60/70/80?
b) how can clk_prepare_enable() write 0x00010005 to JZ_REG_LCD_OSDC? Bug =
or feature?
   Something in cgu driver going wrong?
c) what do your SoC or panels do if you write 0x5 to JZ_REG_LCD_OSDC?
d) 0x00010005 also has bit 16 set which is undocumented... But this is a =
don't care
   according to jz4780 PM.

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
