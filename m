Thanks for looking into it so quickly so we could figure out a path
forward.

Sounds good. I will rework the series to use kvm_mmu_memory_cache
structs for the SP allocation during eager page splitting. That will
eliminate the separate allocation and initialization which will be a
nice cleanup. And it will be great to get rid of the spp crud.

And per your earlier feedback, I will also limit eager page splitting to
nested MMUs.

The NULL vcpu check will be a little gross, but it should never trigger
in practice since eager page splitting always requests direct SPs. My
preference has been to enforce that in code by splitting out
__kvm_mmu_find_shadow_page(), but I can see the advantage of your
proposal is that eager page splitting and faults will go through the
exact same code path to get a kvm_mmu_page.
