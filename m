I agree and that was my reasoning for sending a patch to also convert
to bool the phy driver that this PCIe controller uses. When the pull
request was sent from Vinod to Greg, Greg refused to take it because
of that commit and the commit was reverted and a new pull request was
sent including this revert. This is commit 15692a80d949 ("phy: Revert
"phy: ralink: Kconfig: convert mt7621-pci-phy into 'bool'""). Because
of this I also changed the PCIe controller Kconfig from bool to
tristate when I sent v3 of the series which at the end were the ones
that was finally taken. There are also other ralink related symbols
that have been exported to allow to compile other drivers as a
modules, like the watchdog. See the commit fef532ea0cd8 ("MIPS:
ralink: export rt_sysc_membase for rt2880_wdt.c"). So, as I said, I
agree and I am using the driver as if it were a bool and also ralink
systems normally require all drivers built-in, but I think we have to
take into account also the "historical facts" here. In any case,
Bjorn, let me know if you want me to send whatever patch might be
needed.
