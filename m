I've just posted "[PATCH 0/7] tee: shared memory updates",
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210609102324.2222332-1-jens.wiklander@linaro.org/

Where tee_shm_alloc() is replaced by among other functions
tee_shm_alloc_kernel_buf(). tee_shm_alloc_kernel_buf() takes care of the
problem with TEE_SHM_DMA_BUF.

Cheers,
Jens
