 AFAIK the MIPS port is only maintained on the best effort basis nowadays 
I'm afraid.  I.e. it's enthusiasts investing their free time for the joy 
of fiddling with things.  So things are bound to break from time to time 
and remain unnoticed for a while.  We're doing our best, but our resources 
are limited.

 Taking these limitations into account I think Thomas has been doing a 
tremendous job maintaining the MIPS port, but he hasn't been cc-ed on the 
submission of the original change and it's very easy to miss stuff in the 
flood that has only been posted to a mailing list.
