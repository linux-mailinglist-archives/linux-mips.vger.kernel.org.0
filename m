Which compiles on arm64 but then fails on x86 because of the way pmd_val()
has been defined there. on arm64 and s390 (with many others) pmd_val() is
a macro which still got the variable that can be used as lvalue but that is
not true for some other platforms like x86.

arch/arm64/include/asm/pgtable-types.h:	#define pmd_val(x)	((x).pmd)
arch/s390/include/asm/page.h:		#define pmd_val(x)	((x).pmd)
arch/x86/include/asm/pgtable.h:		#define pmd_val(x)       native_pmd_val(x)

static inline pmdval_t native_pmd_val(pmd_t pmd)
{
        return pmd.pmd;
}

Unless I am mistaken, the return value from this function can not be used as
lvalue for future assignments.

mm/arch_pgtable_test.c: In function ‘pud_clear_tests’:
mm/arch_pgtable_test.c:156:17: error: lvalue required as left operand of assignment
  pud_val(*pudp) |= RANDOM_ORVALUE;
                 ^~
AFAICS pxx_val() were never intended to be used as lvalue and using it that way
might just happen to work on all those platforms which define them as macros.
They meant to just provide values for an entry as being determined by the platform.

In principle pxx_val() on an entry was not supposed to be modified directly from
generic code without going through (again) platform helpers for any specific state
change (write, old, dirty, special, huge etc). The current use case is a deviation
for that.

I originally went with memset() just to load up the entries with non-zero value so
that we know pxx_clear() are really doing the clearing. The same is being followed
for all pxx_same() checks.

Another way for fixing the problem would be to mark them with known attributes
like write/young/huge etc instead which for sure will create non-zero entries.
We can do that for pxx_clear() and pxx_same() tests and drop RANDOM_NZVALUE
completely. Does that sound good ?

Normally they are set during program loading but we can set it up explicitly
for the test mm_struct if we need to but there are some other challenges.

load_[aout|elf|flat|..]_binary()
	setup_new_exec()
		arch_pick_mmap_layout().

I did some initial experiments around get_unmapped_area(). Seems bit tricky
to get it working on a pure 'test' mm_struct. It expects a real user context
in the form of current->mm.

get_unmapped_area()
{
	....
	get_area = current->mm->get_unmapped_area;
	....
	addr = get_area(file, addr, len, pgoff, flags); {
		....
		struct mm_struct *mm = current->mm;
		....
		if (addr) {
			...
			vma = find_vma_prev(mm, addr, &prev);
		}
		....
		vm_unmapped_area() {
			struct mm_struct *mm = current->mm;
			....
			/* Walks across mm->mm_rb.rb_node */
		}
	}
	....
}	

Simple call like get_unmapped_area(NULL, 0, PAGE_SIZE, 0, 0) to get an
address fails right away on current->mm->get_unmapped_area which does
not have a valid value in the kernel context.

There might be two methods to get around this problem

1) Write a custom get_unmapped_area() imitating the real one but going
   around the problem by taking an appropriately initialized mm_struct
   instead of current->mm.

2) Create dummy user task with dummy mm, switch 'current' context before
   calling into get_unmapped_area() and switch back again. Dont know if
   this is even possible.

Wondering if this might deviate too much from the original goal of
testing the page table helpers.

Looking back again at the proposed test vaddr, wondering what will be the
real problem in case it goes beyond user address range ? Will pxx_alloc()
fail to create page table ranges at required level ? Apart from skipping
pgtable_page_ctor/dtor for page table pages, it might not really affect
any helpers as such.

VADDR_TEST (PGDIR_SIZE + [P4D_SIZE] + PUD_SIZE + PMD_SIZE + PAGE_SIZE)

OR

A random page aligned address in [FIRST_USER_ADDRESS..TASK_SIZE] range ?
