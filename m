 Still the bootstrap firmware (say U-boot, as I can see it mentioned in 
your reference) can write the correct value to the class code register.  
Or can it?

 I guess you can try it and report your findings back.  You can poke at 
PCI/e registers directly from U-boot (`pci write.w', etc.) as with any 
reasonable firmware monitor, no need to write code; I guess you probably 
know that already.

 I have no such hardware and I have no incentive to chase documentation 
for it even if public copies are available for the affected devices.  
Also you say it's IP rather than actual discrete chips as it used to be 
with the Galileo system controllers, so it could be up to the customer to 
get the IP wired/configured correctly.

 Well, I have all kinds of information.
