Oh, it's most definitely not less code, and probably more churn.  But, it's churn
that pushes us in a more favorable direction and that is desirable long term.  I
don't mind churning code, but I want the churn to make future life easier, not
harder.  Details below.

They can be implemented on top, but I want to avoid inhireting complexity we
don't actually want/need, unsync support being the most notable.

What I mean by "fork" is that after the cleanups that make sense irrespective of
eager page splitting, we make a copy of FNAME(page_fault) and add FNAME(get_shadow_page),
extracting common logic where we can and probably doing something fancy to avoid
having multiple copies of FNAME(get_shadow_page).  Looking again at the code, it's
probably best to keep FNAME(fetch), at least for now, as it's only the single unsync
check that we can purge at this point.

That gives us e.g. FNAME(nested_page_fault) that support EPT and 64-bit NPT, and
a nested TDP specific get_shadow_page().

Then we rip out the unsync stuff for nested MMUs, which is quite clean because we
can key off of tdp_enabled.  It'll leave dead code for 32-bit hosts running nested
VMs, but I highly doubt anyone will notice the perf hit.

At that point, dissect kvm_nested_mmu_get_page() for eager page splitting and
continue on.

It's not drastically different than what you have now, but it avoids the nastiness
around unsync pages, e.g. I'm pretty sure kvm_mmu_alloc_shadow_page() can be reused
as I proposed and the "find" becomes something like:

static struct kvm_mmu_page *kvm_mmu_nested_tdp_find_sp(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu,
						       gfn_t gfn,
						       unsigned int gfn_hash,
						       union kvm_mmu_page_role role)
{
	struct hlist_head *sp_list = &kvm->arch.mmu_page_hash[gfn_hash];
	struct kvm_mmu_page *sp;

	for_each_valid_sp(kvm, sp, sp_list) {
		if (sp->gfn != gfn || sp->role.word != role.word)
			continue;

		__clear_sp_write_flooding_count(sp);
		return sp;
	}

	return NULL;
}

Having the separate page fault and get_shadow_page(), without the baggage of unsync
in particular, sets us up for switching to taking mmu_lock for read, and in the
distant future, implementing whatever new scheme someone concocts for shadowing
nested TDP.
