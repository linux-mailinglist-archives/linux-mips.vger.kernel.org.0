I can confirm that running 6.12.5 on a P9 host, trying to boot a 6.6
32-bit kernel gave me:

Which is the same thing that happens if you boot a 32-bit Linux kernel
on a physical 64-bit Power machine.  This is probably because KVM is
so much more accurate than TCG for Power emulation :)

That said, I would like to keep the support alive for more than just
ppc32 kernel testing.  There are plenty of Power Macs with enough
memory to run some environments within KVM.  Ad=C3=A9lie=E2=80=99s new =
release
boots a full XFCE desktop in under 300 MB RAM, so even a 1 GB machine
has enough memory to run AmigaOS, Mac OS 9, or another XFCE in KVM.

I have found a few bugs in testing newer kernels, and one of them
affects all targets lower than Power7, which means 32-bit and 64-bit BE.
I am preparing to send those patches in.  I will continue shaking out
any remaining bugs on my 32-bit host.  I hope that these patches can
be useful, and possibly stimulate more interest so 32-bit support can
be maintained again.

In fairness, I do agree that there is very little value in keeping =
32-bit
MIPS or RISC-V support since the chips that support it are so limited.
32-bit Power however serves actual purposes.  32-bit x86 could be useful
to make sure =E2=80=9CKVM on 32-bit in general=E2=80=9D is easier to =
keep going,
but if it is causing maintenance issues then I suppose it can go.

Sincerely,
-Anna=
