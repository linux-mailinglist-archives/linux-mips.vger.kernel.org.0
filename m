I didn't see the conversation with Greg, so I don't know the whole
story.

For pcie-mt7621.c, it looks like the only problem is
setup_cm_memory_region(), which does a little coherency-related stuff.
If we could move that to arch/mips, we could still make this tristate.

One way might be to implement a pcibios_root_bridge_prepare() for mips
and put the setup_cm_memory_region() stuff in there.  It's not *ideal*
because that's a strong/weak function arrangement that doesn't allow
for multiple host bridges, but that's probably not an issue here.

If we can't do that, I think making it bool is probably the right
answer, but it would be worth a brief comment in the commit log to
explain the issue.
