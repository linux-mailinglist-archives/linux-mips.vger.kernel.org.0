It's my fault, last year I made an OTG driver for Ingenic SoCs and sent it
to the mailing list, and then I received some revision comments, but for
some personal reasons I didn't continue to improve it.

I'll finish these modifications as soon as possible and send them out.
Then after they merge into the mainline, this problem will be solved.


Thanks and best regards!
