All at once is good, I like the idea, but:

That's great, but none of these conversions actually get rid of the
global structure, so what actually was helped here other than the churn
of this "potentially" allowing the global data variables from being
removed in the future?

So how does this actually help?

Also, small nit, make the function pointers const please :)
