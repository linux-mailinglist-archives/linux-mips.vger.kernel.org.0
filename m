In my opinion, the position of `reviewer` normally means more
obligation instead of
power.
The world is always changing, I don't think that the world needs to
wait for anybody.

In the open source community, if a person has some position, if
they/he/she has little
time to play that position well, he should do something, for example, seek =
help
or transfer the position to somebody who can work well.

I think that it depends. If the patch can solve a part of this problem, and
won't leave some problem hard to solve in the future or serious
security problems.
I think that it is worth considering.

Yes, I agree with a sentence from you "Nobody's perfect", and the same goes=
 for
software, even Linux kernel.

PS: I never read the code of this thread, it is just common sense, I guess.

I have noticed that in the note of this series of patches:
     v3:
        -- Make each patch can be built without errors and warnings.

I think that how to split the patches is a trade off, not a principle.
For me, the reasons to split patches are:
   1. Make the problem obviously.
   2. Show the problem one by one, and it is easy to understand.
   3. Make life easier for distributors.
   4. And maybe more

While if a splitting conflicts with these purposes, it will be another stor=
y.
