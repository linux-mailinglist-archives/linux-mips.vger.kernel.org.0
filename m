This series is based on top of the three resource fitting and
assignment algorithm fixes (v3).

PCI resource fitting and assignment code needs to find the bridge
window a resource belongs to in multiple places, yet, no common
function for that exists. Thus, each site has its own version of
the decision, each with their own corner cases, misbehaviors, and
some resulting in complex interfaces between internal functions.

This series tries to rectify the situation by adding two new functions
to select the bridge window. To support these functions, bridge windows
must always contain their type information in flags which requires
modifying the flags behavior for bridge window resources.

I've hit problems related to zeroed resource flags so many times by now
that I've already lost count which has highlighted over and over again
that clearing type information is not a good idea. As also proven by
some changes of this series, retaining the flags for bridge windows
ended up fixing existing issues (although kernel ended up recovering
from the worst problem graciously and the other just results in dormant
code).

This series only changes resource flags behavior for bridge windows.
The sensible direction is to make a similar change for the other
resources as well eventually but making that change involves more
uncertainty and is not strictly necessary yet. Driver code outside of
PCI core could have assumptions about the flags, whereas bridge windows
are mostly internal to PCI core code (or should be, sane endpoint
drivers shouldn't be messing with the bridge windows). Thus, limiting
the flags behavior changes to bridge windows for now is safer than
attempting full behavioral change in a single step.


I've tried to look out for any trouble that code under arch/ could
cause after the flags start to behave differently and therefore ended
up consolidating arch/ code to use pci_enable_resources(). My
impression is that strictly speaking only the MIPS code would break
similar to PCI core's copy of pci_enable_resources(), the others were
much more lax in checking so they'd likely keep working but
consolidation seemed still the best approach there as the enable checks
seemed diverging for no apparent reason.

Most sites are converted by this change. There are three known places
that are not yet converted:

  - fail_type based logic in __assign_resources_sorted():
    I'm expecting to cover this along with the resizable BAR
    changes as I need to change the fallback logic anyway (one
    of the motivators what got me started with this series,
    I need an easy way to acquire the bridge window during
    retries/fallbacks if maximum sized BARs do not fit, which
    is what this series provides).

  - Failure detection after BAR resize: Keeps using the type
    based heuristic for failure detection. It isn't very clear how
    to decide which assignment failures should be counted and which
    not. There could be pre-existing failures that keep happening
    that end up blocking BAR resize but that's no worse than behavior
    before this series. How to identify the relevant failures does
    not look straightforward given the current structures. This
    clearly needs more thought before coding any solution.

  - resource assignment itself: This is a very complex change
    due to bus and kernel resources abstractions and might not be
    realistic any time soon.

I'd have wanted to also get rid of pci_bridge_check_ranges() that
(re)adds type information which seemed now unnecessary. It turns out,
however, that root windows still require so it will have to wait for
now.

This change has been tested on a large number of machine I've access to
which come with heterogeneous PCI configurations. Some resources
retained their original addresses now also with pci=realloc because
this series fixed the unnecessary release(+assign) of those resources.
Other than that, nothing worth of note from that testing.


My test coverage is x86 centric unfortunately so I'd appreciate if
somebody with access to non-x86 archs takes the effort to test this
series.

Info for potential testers:

Usually, it's enough to gather lspci -vvv pre and post the series, and
use diff to see whether the resources remained the same and also check
that the same drivers are still bound to the devices to confirm that
devices got properly enabled (also shown by lspci -vvv). I normally
test both with and without pci=realloc. In case of a trouble, besides
lspci -vvv output, providing pre and post dmesg and /proc/iomem
contents would be helpful, please take the dmesg with dyndbg="file
drivers/pci/*.c +p" on the kernel cmdline.
