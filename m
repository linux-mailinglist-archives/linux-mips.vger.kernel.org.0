I have no problem at all to just move the driver instead of add and
remove. But it is easier to review initially in this way. No other
reason but this one. So, if after review is ok, we can just move this
in the way you are pointing out here.

Most pci drivers in 'arch/mips/pci' are still using PCI_LEGACY stuff.
In contrast mt7621-pci is using current pci generic apis but even most
of the code is generic enough, there is one remaining thing which
depends on mips architecture which is the iocu region configuration
which must be done in the driver itself. This is the only reason to
move this driver into 'arch/mips/pci' instead of
'drivers/pci/controller/'. So... I am all ears to listen to
suggestions for the proper place for this driver. Thomas, do you have
any thoughts on this?
