Thanks for clarification. That's actually the reason why I originally
added the ioremap_wc() support to the MIPS32 arch. In one of the
projects we had SM750/SM768-based graphic cards attached to the
MIPS32-based SoC. Using ioremap_wc() for the framebuffer significantly
improved the graphic subsystem performance indeed. It was mostly
required for the SM750 chips though, which provided a narrow and slow
PCIe Gen.1 x1 interface.

I don't know about ARM64 (which for instance has it utilized to access
the DMI region), but at least in case of MIPS32 (a fortiori MIPS64
seeing the ioremap_cache() method actually returns a pointer to the
uncached region) I don't see a reason why it wouldn't be safe in both
cases described by you. All IO and memory regions are accessed by the
generic load and store instructions. The only difference is that the
MMIO-space accessors normally implies additional barriers, which just
slow down the execution, but shouldn't cause any other problem. Could
you clarify why do you think otherwise?

I see. Thanks for the pointing out to that. I guess it could be done
for MIPS too (at least on our MIPS32 platform DMI is just a memory
region pre-initialized by the bootloader), but the conversion would
require much efforts. Alas currently I can't afford to get it
implemented in the framework of this patchset. (I saved your note in
my MIPS TODO list though. Let's hope eventually I'll be able to get
back to this topic.)
