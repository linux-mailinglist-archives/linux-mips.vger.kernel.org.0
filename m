Hi,

I cannot really comment on mips arch specifics but few words from the live 
patching perspective.

DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_ARGS has been introduced recently, so you might also 
look at that. As far as the live patching is concerned, 
DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_ARGS is sufficient.

You may want to look at Documentation/livepatch/reliable-stacktrace.rst 
which nicely describes the requirements for the reliable stacktraces.
