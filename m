Well, I just wonder why the elegant devm_regulator_get_optional() exists =
at all
and seems to be used in ca. 80 places.

And if it is not allowed, why some DTS should be forced to add not =
physically existing dummy-regulators.
AFAIR drivers should implement functionality defined by DTS but not the =
other way round: enforce DTS style.
BTW: there is no +5 mains dummy regulator defined in ci20.dts.

What I fear is that if we always have to define the mains +5V (which is =
for example not
defined in ci20.dts), which rules stops us from asking to add a =
dummy-regulator from 110/230V to +5V as well.
In last consequence, it seems as if we have to describe all dummy =
regulators from the power plant to our hdmi-5v :)

Since I always follow the KISS principle I tend to leave out what is not =
relevant...

Of course adding a dummy regulator to the DTS allows to avoid the NULL =
pointer test
in the driver code.

Anyways, you are maintainers :)

So should I spin a v11 for the series or just this patch or how should =
we do it?

BR and thanks,
Nikolaus
