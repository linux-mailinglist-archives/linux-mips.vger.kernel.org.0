I saw in the "arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-ls1012a-frdm.dts" file 
that the clock
node was placed inside the SC16IS752 node, and I found that some 
RaspberryPi developers
did the same. I think the reason them do this may be because the clock 
of SC16IS752 is
provided by the oscillator circuit inside the chip (an external crystal 
oscillator is
required). If you feel this is inappropriate, I will leave the clock 
node alone.

I think it seems that the grandchild node scheme should be more in line 
with the
current situation, since on further exploration I found these:

/sys/bus/platform/devices/10043000.spi/spi_master/spi0/spi0.0/serial0/serial0-0
/sys/bus/platform/devices/10043000.spi/spi_master/spi0/spi0.0/serial1/serial1-0

This means that for the SC16IS752 chip there are two serial device buses 
(one for
each serial port). The previous experimental results have proved that 
the current
driver does not seem to be able to correctly determine the 
correspondence between
two child nodes and two serial device buses, and when I removed the 2nd 
bluetooth
device (both module hardware and device tree node) and put the clock 
node alone,
I got these:

[    1.208848] Bluetooth: HCI UART driver ver 2.3
[    1.213302] Bluetooth: HCI UART protocol H4 registered
[    1.220201] hci_uart_bcm serial0-0: No reset resource, using default 
baud rate
[    1.227717] Bluetooth: HCI UART protocol Broadcom registered
[    1.240239] hci_uart_bcm: probe of serial1-0 failed with error -16

The device tree at this time looks like this:

&ssi0 {
     status = "okay";

     num-cs = <2>;

     pinctrl-names = "default";
     pinctrl-0 = <&pins_ssi0>;

     sc16is752: expander@0 {
         compatible = "nxp,sc16is752";
         reg = <0>; /* CE0 */

         spi-rx-bus-width = <1>;
         spi-tx-bus-width = <1>;
         spi-max-frequency = <4000000>;

         clocks = <&exclk_sc16is752>;

         interrupt-parent = <&gpb>;
         interrupts = <18 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;

         gpio-controller;
         #gpio-cells = <2>;

         bluetooth {
          compatible = "brcm,bcm43438-bt";
          max-speed = <1000000>;

          device-wakeup-gpios = <&gpc 26 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
          reset-gpios = <&gpb 17 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
         };
     };
};

I guess this is also because the current driver can't correctly 
determine the
correspondence between the child node and the two serial device buses:

Both serial device buses think that this child node corresponds to 
themselves,
so they both try to register it, but because now ttySC1 (corresponding 
to the
second serial device bus) is not connected to any bluetooth module, 
resulting
in registration failure.

If there are child nodes to represent each port, the correspondence between
the slave devices (grandchild node) and the serial device buses (child node)
will be very clear. But unfortunately, it seems that the current SC16IS752
driver does not support this form (at least there is no relevant information
in the "Example" given in nxp,sc16is7xx.txt).

I'm not too sure what kind of modifications need to be made to the SC16IS752
driver to achieve this, could you please give me some guidance (or 
examples)?


Thanks and best regards!
