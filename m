Well, drivers/pci/controller code should at least try to be arch
agnostic to belong there, there are exceptions, as I said but
they are the exception not the rule.

Eg no <asm/...> includes required; its code can in principle be
reused on other arches, this series can't, it is arch code IMO.

I am not convinced it will buy you much to be honest, I might be wrong.

If we move the code we have to have a compelling reason for it to
happen and at the moment I do not necessarily see one, happy to
be proven wrong if you extend it to support other platforms cleanly
(eg with firmware bindings) on top of this series.

I can't certainly maintain it, it is too MIPS specific and I do not like
this code either but that's certainly not your fault.

- Hardcoded resources
- No firmware bindings
- Lots of MIPS specific workarounds
- arch code dependency

I do not think that as it stands it belongs in driver/pci/controller,
no.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
