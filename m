Can you explain to me, why are resources temporarily removed from the
'bridge->windows' list?

Would moving that list split to be done after
'pcibios_root_bridge_prepare()' is called a possibility?

Obviously doing this works and windows are passed into mips ralink
specific 'pcibios_root_bridge_prepare()' and the PCIe subsystem is
properly working.

The advantages I see to this approach are that doing in this way lets us to:
- Remove specific mips code from the driver controller.
- Allow the driver to be compile tested for any architecture.

And the changes would be the following patches:
1) Small 'drivers/pci/probe.c' change.
2) Move mips specific code into 'arch/mips/ralink/mt76721.c' (since
other mips ralink stuff haven't got IO coherency units) to be inside
'pcibios_root_bridge_prepare()'.
3) Add MODULE_LICENSE macro to the PCIe controller driver to avoid
complaints when the driver is compiled as a module .
4) Update PCIe controller driver's Kconfig to avoid MIPS COMPILE_TEST
conditional and completely enable it for COMPILE_TEST.

When you have time, please, let me know your thoughts about this.

Thanks in advance for your time.
