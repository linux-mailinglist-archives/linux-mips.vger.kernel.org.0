I think I lack some experience of cross-subsystem development, so in
V8 I only adjust the context of my own patches to let the series be
applied on kvm tree, but didn't consider patches already in other
trees (Moreover, that patch is not mine). So, should I send a V9 that
take commit 3fbfb4585bfd4ff3 together?

Thanks,
Huacai
