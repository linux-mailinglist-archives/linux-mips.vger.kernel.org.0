The bindings txt file removed in staging with this patchset was also
added by me three years ago[0], and has been changing until the YAML
bindings are reviewed by Rob and driver updated accordly in this
patchset.
OpenWRT maintains its own file[1] which I don't know is updated or not
according to the one in staging which I am pretending to properly
mainline for 5.17. But yes, I agree there might be firmware out there
using current compatible string.

bindings for mt7621 pcie controller")
