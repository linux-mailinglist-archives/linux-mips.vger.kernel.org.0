Those were actually meant to discuss on different things. u16 is the 
oldest part of change and the reason why it is only u16 is that I
didn't need more than that to store the bits used for the mask.

That "consistent" part was written to note that there are case which check 
only e.g. TEMT flag. As TEMT is within first 8 bits, it doesn't absolutely 
need more than unsigned char but I enlarged those types regardless.
I agree with you though the wording doesn't convey meaning exclusive to 
those cases.

> So why not use u16 for everyone?

If that consistency is necessary, I'd be more inclined to make the ones in 
the uart_8250_port unsigned int instead. The reason is that it would then 
align better to read/ignore_status_mask that are already unsigned int. 
Would it be ok or do you still prefer u16?
