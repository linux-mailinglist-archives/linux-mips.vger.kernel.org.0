I'm not Florian, but I worked a bit with AR7 as well, and going
through the (previously) supported/known devices they topped out at 8
MiB Flash and 32 MiB RAM, which isn't enough to run any reasonably
modern OpenWrt even if one would be willing to re-add support for it.

So from my perspective I suggest even dropping the AR7 code entirely.
I seriously doubt anyone is running a modern kernel on that.

Jonas
