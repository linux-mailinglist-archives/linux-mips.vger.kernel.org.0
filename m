Yes, that was my mistake, whether or not the interrupt-names need to
be "required" is another issue. It does not cause a check warning.
I'll think about it some more.

There is a match between interrupts, interrupt names and interrupt maps:

interrupt->interrupt name->interrupt map
2->int0->int_map[0]
3->int1->int_map[1]
4->int2->int_map[2]
5->int3->int_map[3]

As part of the 2k1000 liointc1 node:

                liointc1: interrupt-controller@1fe11440 {
....
                        interrupt-parent =3D <&cpuintc>;
                        interrupts =3D <3>;
                        interrupt-names =3D "int1";

                        loongson,parent_int_map =3D <0x00000000>, /* int0 *=
/
                                                <0xffffffff>, /* int1 */
                                                <0x00000000>, /* int2 */
                                                <0x00000000>; /* int3 */
                };

To ensure this mapping relationship, the interrupt name becomes the
intermediate bridge.

Actually now we are all starting at int0.
Since the 2K1000 has 64 interrupt sources, we need two nodes to route
the interrupts. Usually liointc0 (handle 0-31 interrupts sources )uses
int0 and liointc1 (handle 32-63 interrupts sources ) uses int1.
As follows:

                liointc0: interrupt-controller@1fe11400 {
.....
                        interrupt-parent =3D <&cpuintc>;
                        interrupts =3D <2>;
                        interrupt-names =3D "int0";

                        loongson,parent_int_map =3D <0xffffffff>, /* int0 *=
/
                                                <0x00000000>, /* int1 */
                                                <0x00000000>, /* int2 */
                                                <0x00000000>; /* int3 */
                };

                liointc1: interrupt-controller@1fe11440 {
....
                        interrupt-parent =3D <&cpuintc>;
                        interrupts =3D <3>;
                        interrupt-names =3D "int1";

                        loongson,parent_int_map =3D <0x00000000>, /* int0 *=
/
                                                <0xffffffff>, /* int1 */
                                                <0x00000000>, /* int2 */
                                                <0x00000000>; /* int3 */
                };

At this point, liointc1 will be warned that it is not starting from
int0, and that int0 is actually being used by liointc0.

This is mainly due to discontinuities in register definitions.

Interrupt routing configuration involves two aspects of registers (32 bits)=
:
1. interrupt configuration registers: including interrupt enable,
interrupt status, etc;
2. the CORE routing register: indicating which CORE to route to.

First of all, for liointc-1.0, e.g. Loongson-3A, they are contiguous
and we only need a set of register definitions, so reg-names are not
needed.

                liointc: interrupt-controller@3ff01400 {
                        compatible =3D "loongson,liointc-1.0";
                        reg =3D <0 0x3ff01400 0x64>;
...........
                };

However, for liointc-2.0, e.g. Loongson-2K1000, they are not
contiguous and we can only define them separately (main/isr0/isr1).

                liointc0: interrupt-controller@1fe11400 {
                        compatible =3D "loongson,liointc-2.0";
                        reg =3D <0 0x1fe11400 0 0x40>,
                                <0 0x1fe11040 0 0x8>,
                                <0 0x1fe11140 0 0x8>;
                        reg-names =3D "main", "isr0", "isr1";
..........
                };


Unfortunately, the Loongson-2K0500 is again special in that it is a
single-core CPU. therefore the core1 routing register (isr1) does not
exist.

                liointc0: interrupt-controller@1fe11400 {
                        compatible =3D "loongson,liointc-2.0";
                        reg =3D <0x0 0x1fe11400 0x0 0x40>,
                              <0x0 0x1fe11040 0x0 0x8>;
                        reg-names =3D "main", "isr0";
......
                };

So I would like to set the minItems of reg-names to 2 (main/isr0).

Thanks.
