Ok. Thank you very much for the comprehensive response. I'll give a
good thought towards moving our platform to the sparse memory config. Most
likely it will be done together with reducing SECTION_SIZE_BITS to
128MB in order to save a few more low-memory space. This will be
mostly useful it XPA is enabled and 8GB memory is available. Such case
requires a lot of low-memory for mapping, which is of just 128MB in
our device.
