 Yeah, for this particular change, sure.  I don't have QEMU set up however 
at the moment and would have to take some time to sort it, and it won't do 
for peripherals it doesn't implement.  The failure is a fresh problem and 
I yet need to figure out what to do about it.  A bad coincidence I guess 
as I have MIPS hardware 10 years older that still goes strong.
