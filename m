The fact that Laurent is using dw-hdmi with 
DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR on Renesas makes me think that it's 
possible here as well. There's no reason why it shouldn't work with 
ingenic-drm.

The ingenic-drm driver does not need to create any connector. The 
"connector-hdmi" is connected to dw-hdmi as the "next bridge" in the 
list.

Where would the errno be returned? Why would drm_bridge_attach() return 
an error code?

There's drm_bridge_funcs.detect().
