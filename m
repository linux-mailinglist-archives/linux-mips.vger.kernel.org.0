I mean "look at all the code that is run between the old site and the
new site to make sure that none of that code depends on
bridge->windows being temporarily emptied."

This is definitely too big for v5.16, regardless of which way you go.
For v5.16, the only thing that's practical is to avoid building as a

not a requirement.
