Note that it's pretty common on laptop GPUs to have the attached
panel's EDID be baked into the VBIOS or ACPI (for LVDS / eDP). The hw
drivers in question (e.g. nouveau, radeon, probably i915) know how to
retrieve it specially. I'm no DT expert, but I'd imagine that it's
meant to allow mirroring those types of configurations. Stuff like
"drm.edid_firmware" isn't really meant for system-configuration-level
things, more as an out in case something doesn't work as it should.
