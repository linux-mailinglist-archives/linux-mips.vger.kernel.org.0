Ah, I assumed offlining was disallowed if TDX was enabled.

The alternative isn't really viable because there's no way the kernel can guarantee
a CPU can be onlined, i.e. the kernel would need to fallback of disallowing TD
creation anyways.

Is this actually a TODO?  I assume the kernel doesn't actually try to offline
CPUs in this case, i.e. it Just Works.

Looks good, disallowing SUSPEND with active TDs is a reasonable tradeoff.  As
above, I highly doubt anyone actually cares.
