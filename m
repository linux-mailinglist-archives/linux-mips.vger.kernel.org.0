I see. I'd assumed that that was what you're using. I agree that it's
not completely correct, so for the moment, I assume that if that
happens we have a misbehaving host, teardown the guest and reclaim its
memory.

Yup.

Thanks for pointing that out. I think this might be the way to go.
I'll have a closer look at this and see how to get it to work with
pKVM.
