OK, that's really ugly, but I guess we can't do anything about it.  It
would be helpful to make the comment say something like:

  The address space consumed by these devices is outside the resources
  of the host bridge.

Side note: in ACPI systems, the ACPI namespace is supposed to describe
all resources consumed by all devices.  Does DT have a similar
expectation?  Is there something in DT that tells us about the address
space used by these devices?  Even if that space never overlaps with
the PCI host bridge apertures, it might be useful to show the space in
/proc/iomem and similar places.
