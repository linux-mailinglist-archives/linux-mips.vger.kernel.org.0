I know, put edid blob in the dts maybe abuse, but i am not push dts with edid blob either.

It is left to other people, and the ./arch/powerpc/boot/dts/ac14xx.dts already have edid blob.

It is extremely difficult to use, it have difficulty to specify which firmware edid is for which connector.
because we have a 1024x600 panel and a 1920x1080 monitor.

It require you to know the connector's name at first, it is not as intuitive as my method.
I am exhausted by it.
