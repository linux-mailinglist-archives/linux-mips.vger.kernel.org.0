Not at all. If the clock is disabled, the LCD controller is disabled, 
so all the registers read zero, this makes sense. You can only read the 
registers when the clock is enabled. On some SoCs, reading disabled 
registers can even cause a complete lockup.

Why is this JZ_LCD_OSDC_ALPHAEN bit needed now? I remember it working 
fine last time I tried, and now I indeed get a black screen unless this 
bit is set. The PM doesn't make it obvious that the bit is required, 
but that wouldn't be surprising.

Anyway, feel free to send a patch to fix it (with a Fixes: tag). 
Ideally something like this:

u32 osdc = 0;
...
if (soc_info->has_osd)
    osdc |= JZ_LCD_OSDC_OSDEN;
if (soc_info->has_alpha)
    osdc |= JZ_LCD_OSDC_ALPHAEN;
regmap_write(priv->map, JZ_REG_LCD_OSDC, osdc);

This also ensures that the OSDC register is properly initialized in the 
!has_osd case. The driver shouldn't rely on pre-boot values in the 
registers.

Cheers,
-Paul
