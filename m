This series extends KVM's Eager Page Splitting to also split huge pages
mapped by the shadow MMU, i.e. huge pages present in the memslot rmaps.
This will be useful for configurations that use Nested Virtualization,
disable the TDP MMU, or disable/lack TDP hardware support.

For background on Eager Page Splitting, see:
 - Proposal: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/CALzav=dV_U4r1K9oDq4esb4mpBQDQ2ROQ5zH5wV3KpOaZrRW-A@mail.gmail.com/
 - TDP MMU support: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20220119230739.2234394-1-dmatlack@google.com/

Splitting huge pages mapped by the shadow MMU is more complicated than
the TDP MMU, but it is also more important for performance as the shadow
MMU handles huge page write-protection faults under the write lock.  See
the Performance section for more details.

The extra complexity of splitting huge pages mapped by the shadow MMU
comes from a few places:

(1) The shadow MMU has a limit on the number of shadow pages that are
    allowed to be allocated. So, as a policy, Eager Page Splitting
    refuses to split if there are KVM_MIN_FREE_MMU_PAGES or fewer
    pages available.

(2) Huge pages may be mapped by indirect shadow pages.

    - Indirect shadow pages have the possibilty of being unsync. As a
      policy we opt not to split such pages as their translation may no
      longer be valid.
    - Huge pages on indirect shadow pages may have access permission
      constraints from the guest (unlike the TDP MMU which is ACC_ALL
      by default).

(3) Splitting a huge page may end up re-using an existing lower level
    shadow page tables. This is unlike the TDP MMU which always allocates
    new shadow page tables when splitting.

(4) When installing the lower level SPTEs, they must be added to the
    rmap which may require allocating additional pte_list_desc structs.

In Google's internal implementation of Eager Page Splitting, we do not
handle cases (3) and (4), and intstead opts to skip splitting entirely
(case 3) or only partially splitting (case 4). This series handles the
additional cases, which requires an additional 4KiB of memory per VM to
store the extra pte_list_desc cache. However it does also avoids the need
for TLB flushes in most cases and allows KVM to split more pages mapped
by shadow paging.

The bulk of this series is just refactoring the existing MMU code in
preparation for splitting, specifically to make it possible to operate
on the MMU outside of a vCPU context.

Motivation
----------

During dirty logging, VMs using the shadow MMU suffer from:

(1) Write-protection faults on huge pages that take the MMU lock to
    unmap the huge page, map a 4KiB page, and update the dirty log.

(2) Non-present faults caused by (1) that take the MMU lock to map in
    the missing page.

(3) Write-protection faults on 4KiB pages that take the MMU lock to
    make the page writable and update the dirty log. [Note: These faults
    only take the MMU lock during shadow paging.]

The lock contention from (1), (2) and (3) can severely degrade
application performance to the point of failure.  Eager page splitting
eliminates (1) by moving the splitting of huge pages off the vCPU
threads onto the thread invoking VM-ioctls to configure dirty logging,
and eliminates (2) by fully splitting each huge page into its
constituent small pages. (3) is still a concern for shadow paging
workloads (e.g. nested virtualization) but is not addressed by this
series.

Splitting in the VM-ioctl thread is useful because it can run in the
background without interrupting vCPU execution. However, it does take
the MMU lock so it may introduce some extra contention if vCPUs are
hammering the MMU lock. This is offset by the fact that eager page
splitting drops the MMU lock after splitting each SPTE if there is any
contention, and the fact that eager page splitting is reducing the MMU
lock contention from (1) and (2) above. Even workloads that only write
to 5% of their memory see massive MMU lock contention reduction during
dirty logging thanks to Eager Page Splitting (see Performance data
below).

A downside of Eager Page Splitting is that it splits all huge pages,
which may include ranges of memory that are never written to by the
guest and thus could theoretically stay huge. Workloads that write to
only a fraction of their memory may see higher TLB miss costs with Eager
Page Splitting enabled. However, that is secondary to the application
failure that otherwise may occur without Eager Page Splitting.

Further work is necessary to improve the TLB miss performance for
read-heavy workoads, such as dirty logging at 2M instead of 4K.

Performance
-----------

To measure the performance impact of Eager Page Splitting I ran
dirty_log_perf_test with tdp_mmu=N, various virtual CPU counts, 1GiB per
vCPU, and backed by 1GiB HugeTLB memory. The amount of memory that was
written to versus read was controlled with the -f option.

To measure the imapct of customer performance, we can look at the time
it takes all vCPUs to dirty memory after dirty logging has been enabled.
Without Eager Page Splitting enabled, such dirtying must take faults to
split huge pages and bottleneck on the MMU lock.

Eager Page Splitting does increase the time it takes to enable dirty
logging when not using initially-all-set, since that's when KVM splits
huge pages. However, this runs in parallel with vCPU execution and drops
the MMU lock whenever there is contention.

             | Config: ept=Y, tdp_mmu=N, 100% writes                   |
             | Enabling dirty logging time                             |

Similarly, Eager Page Splitting increases the time it takes to clear the
dirty log for when using initially-all-set. The first time userspace
clears the dirty log, KVM will split huge pages:

             | Config: ept=Y, tdp_mmu=N, 100% writes initially-all-set |
             | Iteration 1 clear dirty log time                        |
             | ------------------------------------------------------- |
vCPU Count   | eager_page_split=N         | eager_page_split=Y         |
------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
2            | 0.001599286s               | 0.027095008s               |
4            | 0.003180496s               | 0.053376070s               |
8            | 0.006417064s               | 0.106120759s               |
16           | 0.012826026s               | 0.215146223s               |
32           | 0.027089937s               | 0.444193363s               |
64           | 0.090911208s               | 1.200149758s               |

Subsequent calls to clear the dirty log incur almost no additional cost
since KVM can very quickly determine there are no more huge pages to
split via the RMAP. This is unlike the TDP MMU which must re-traverse
the entire page table to check for huge pages.

             | Config: ept=Y, tdp_mmu=N, 100% writes initially-all-set |
             | Iteration 2 clear dirty log time                        |

Eager Page Splitting also improves the performance for shadow paging
configurations, as measured with ept=N. Although the absolute gains are
less for write-heavy workloads since KVM's shadow paging takes the write
lock to track 4KiB writes (i.e. no fast_page_faut() or PML). However
there are still major gains for read/write and read-heavy workloads.

Testing
-------

- Ran all kvm-unit-tests and KVM selftests with all combinations of
  ept=[NY] and tdp_mmu=[NY].
- Booted a 32-bit non-PAE kernel with shadow paging to verify the
  quadrant change in patch 3.
- Tested VM live migration [*] with ept=N and ept=Y and observed pages
  being split via tracepoint and the pages_* stats.

[*] The live migration setup consisted of an 8 vCPU 8 GiB VM running
    on an Intel Cascade Lake host and backed by 1GiB HugeTLBFS memory.
    The VM was running Debian 10 and a workload that consisted of 16
    independent processes that each dirty memory. The tests were run
    with ept=N to exercise the interaction of Eager Page Splitting and
    shadow paging.
