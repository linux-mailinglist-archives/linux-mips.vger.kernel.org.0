PATCH V17 2022-04-06 18:26:08:

* rebased to v5.18-rc1 based drm-misc/drm-misc-next 

PATCH V16 2022-02-26 18:13:02:

PATCH V12 2022-01-31 13:26:54:
This version reworks how hdmi ddc power is controlled by connector and not
by ddc/hdmi bridge driver.

Also some patches of the previous version of this series have been removed
since they are already applied to mips-next/linux/next/v5.17-rc1.

Fixes and changes:

- fix JZ_REG_LCD_OSDC setup for jz4780 (by hns@goldelico.com and paul@crapouillou.net)
- adjustments for ci20.dts to use connector gpio for +5v (suggested by several)
- to add control of "ddc-en-gpios" to hdmi-connector driver (by hns@goldelico.com)
- regulator code removed because we now use the "ddc-en-gpios" of the connector
  driver (suggested by paul@crapouillou.net)
- bindings: addition of "ddc-i2c-bus" and "hdmi-5v-supply" removed (suggested by robh+dt@kernel.org)
- rebase on v5.17-rc2

PATCH V11 2021-12-02 19:39:52:

PATCH V10 2021-11-30 22:26:41:
- patch 3/8: fix $id and $ref paths (found by robh@kernel.org)

PATCH V9 2021-11-24 22:29:14:
- patch 6/8: remove optional <0> for assigned-clocks and unintentionally included "unwedge" setup (found by paul@crapouillou.net)
- patch 4/8: some cosmetics
             make regulator enable/disable only if not NULL (found by paul@crapouillou.net)
             simplify/fix error handling and driver cleanup on remove (proposed by paul@crapouillou.net)
- patch 3/8: fix #include path in example (found by paul@crapouillou.net)
             fix missing "i" in unevaluatedProperties (found by robh@kernel.org)
             fix 4 spaces indentation for required: property (found by robh@kernel.org)

PATCH V8 2021-11-23 19:14:00:
- fix a bad editing result from patch 2/8 (found by paul@crapouillou.net)

PATCH V7 2021-11-23 18:46:23:
- changed gpio polarity of hdmi_power to 0 (suggested by paul@crapouillou.net)
- fixed LCD1 irq number (bug found by paul@crapouillou.net)
- removed "- 4" for calculating max_register (suggested by paul@crapouillou.net)
- use unevaluatedPropertes instead of additionalProperties (suggested by robh@kernel.org)
- moved and renamed ingenic,jz4780-hdmi.yaml (suggested by robh@kernel.org)
- adjusted assigned-clocks changes to upstream which added some for SSI (by hns@goldelico.com)
- rebased and tested with v5.16-rc2 + patch set drm/ingenic by paul@crapouillou.net (by hns@goldelico.com)

PATCH V6 2021-11-10 20:43:33:
- changed CONFIG_DRM_INGENIC_DW_HDMI to "m" (by hns@goldelico.com)
- made ingenic-dw-hdmi an independent platform driver which can be compiled as module
  and removed error patch fixes for IPU (suggested by paul@crapouillou.net)
- moved assigned-clocks from jz4780.dtsi to ci20.dts (suggested by paul@crapouillou.net)
- fixed reg property in jz4780.dtsi to cover all registers incl. gamma and vee (by hns@goldelico.com)
- added a base patch to calculate regmap size from DTS reg property (requested by paul@crapouillou.net)
- restored resetting all bits except one in LCDOSDC (requested by paul@crapouillou.net)
- clarified setting of cpos (suggested by paul@crapouillou.net)

- improved, simplified, fixed, dtbschecked ingenic-jz4780-hdmi.yaml and made dependent of bridge/synopsys,dw-hdmi.yaml (based on suggestions by maxime@cerno.tech)
- fixed binding vs. driver&DTS use of hdmi-5v regulator (suggested by maxime@cerno.tech)
- dropped "drm/bridge: synopsis: Fix to properly handle HPD" - was a no longer needed workaround for a previous version
  (suggested by maxime@cerno.tech)
