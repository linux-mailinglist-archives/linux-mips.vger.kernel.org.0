This turned out to be an interesting exercise, as we always use an
int for the index, and the xarray iterators insist on an unsigned
long (and even on a pointer to it). On the other hand, I couldn't
spot any case where we'd rely on the last value of the vcpu pointer.

I'll repost the series once we have a solution for patch #4, and
we can then decide whether we want the iterator churn.
