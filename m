Sean, Du,
I saw you are discussing the PLL rate calculation issue.
My question is whether the upstream kernel works on your ls1c300?
For me, it never works, even the earliest version which LS1C support was me=
rged.
After the kernel is loaded by PMON, there is no console output at all.
I also confirm this issue with Yang.
BTW, my board is 1C300B.
Are your board is different from me? Or your bootloader?

Thanks!
