 I have been contacted by Ralf a couple of weeks ago and he told me there 
had been a storage failure with the machine running linux-mips.org.

 Due to a complex situation with linux-mips.org I do not want to dive the 
details of into here recovery of the site caused some trouble, however I 
was told it had been under way now.  So I suggest that we wait a couple of 
weeks yet and see how it goes before going ahead with this series.

 As to Ralf personal commitments WRT maintenance duties I can't speak, but 
I have bcc-ed him on his alternative e-mail address with this message in 
case he wants to speak up.
