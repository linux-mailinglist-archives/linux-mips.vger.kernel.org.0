 I tweaked the core file and set the EF_MIPS_ABI2 flag by hand.  This has 
let GDB proceed:

[...]
warning: File "/usr/lib/debug/.build-id" has no build-id, file skipped
Core was generated by `iperf3 -c 192.168.254.3'.
Program terminated with signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.
#0  0x77eb3190 in ?? (
[...]

but this is a partial core file only and I have no corresponding binaries, 
so I can't tell more at this stage, i.e. what code there is at 0x77eb3190 
(the PC address is suspiciously high in the 32-bit address space BTW, is 
that a PIE run with address space randomisation?).

 Of course GDB shouldn't have hit an internal error with a broken core 
file anyway, it should complain and handle the situation gracefully.  But 
in any case it's an issue with the Linux kernel producing a core file in 
the wrong format.

 Is this the most recent Linux kernel version you have obtained this with?  
There used to be a bug (regression) in Linux with n32 core files, but I 
fixed it also in 2017, with commit 547da673173d ("MIPS: Fix an n32 core 
file generation regset support regression").  So if it has stopped working 
again, then it's a new regression.  Would you be able to bisect it?
