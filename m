One thing worth noting about the JZ4780 is that a lot of the registers that=
=20
might otherwise be used for the above purposes appear to be read-only, at=20
least for the different fields concerned.

=46or example, those affecting ingenic_drm_plane_config:

Control Register (LCDCTRL) - specifically the BPP0 field
OSD Control Register (LCDOSDCTRL)
=46oreground 0 XY Position Register (LCDXYP0)
=46oreground 1 XY Position Register (LCDXYP1)
=46oreground 0 Size Register (LCDSIZE0)
=46oreground 1 Size Register (LCDSIZE1)

These require changes to the extended descriptor members instead, and I am=
=20
fairly sure I mentioned the implications for pixel depth configuration=20
previously. So, as far as I can tell, we would need to update the descripto=
rs,=20
not the registers, to support the operations mentioned above.

As for the f0 plane "not working", I am not aware of any limitation around=
=20
using only f0 (assuming it corresponds to what the manual calls fg0) or onl=
y=20
f1 (again, assuming fg1 in the manual) or both. My assumption was that for=
=20
this particular driver, f0 was reserved for some kind of overlay and that f=
1=20
was to be used for the normal non-overlay display for products where the OS=
D=20
peripheral is provided.

=46rom the definition of struct ingenic_drm:

        /*
         * f1 (aka. foreground1) is our primary plane, on top of which
         * f0 (aka. foreground0) can be overlayed. Z-order is fixed in
         * hardware and cannot be changed.
         */

So, as I understood it, the driver would configure f1 in the case of the=20
JZ4780 for basic display support. Configuring f0 as an overlay should be=20
entirely possible, but I imagine that it needs to change the descriptors, n=
ot=20
the registers, to have a chance of actually working.

I hope this is somewhat useful information. I honestly don't know if, say, =
the=20
JZ4770 has a similar arrangement with regard to configuration via descripto=
rs,=20
as opposed to registers, but I think it is an important distinction between=
=20
devices in this particular family that needs to be accommodated in the driv=
er,=20
and we obviously want to determine how this might best be achieved.
