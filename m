It should be trivial to put the contents of setup_cm_memory_region()
into a ralink function called pcibios_root_bridge_prepare().

pcibios_root_bridge_prepare() is called with the same "struct
pci_host_bridge *" argument as setup_cm_memory_region(), and it's
called slightly later, so the window resources are already set up, so
no DT parsing is required.  It looks like a simple move and rename to
me.
