Hi Paul,
any insights on the JZ_REG_LCD_OSDC issue below?

There is a second, unrelated issue with the introduction of

"drm/bridge: display-connector: implement bus fmts callbacks"

which breaks bus format negotiations.

These are the two last unsolved issues to submit a fully working driver.

more detailled test shows that it is the underlying=20

	clk_enable(priv->lcd_clk)

(i.e. not the prepare).

I now suspect that it is an undocumented SoC feature.
