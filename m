OK, for now I left my rework as-is:

  - changed CONFIG_PCI_MT7621 to CONFIG_PCIE_MT7621
  - renamed mediatek,mt7621-pci.yaml to mediatek,mt7621-pcie.yaml
  - renamed pci-mt7621.c to pcie-mt7621.c
  - kept DT compatible string "mediatek,mt7621-pci" in .yaml and .c

I reason that the Kconfig and filename changes only affect people
building kernels or DTs, but a compatible string change would force a
DT update to be synchronized with a kernel update.

Happy to change this if necessary.

Bjorn
