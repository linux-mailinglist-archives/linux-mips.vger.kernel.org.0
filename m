Hi,

 With the addition of the `need-compiler' variable the `Makefile.compiler' 
fragment is not included with no-build targets such as `modules_install', 
which in turn means $(call cc-option,), etc. are no-ops with these targets 
and any attempt to evaluate these function calls causes all kinds of weird 
behaviour to happen.

 The solution is to avoid making these calls in the first place, as they 
are surely irrelevant where the compiler is not going to be otherwise 
invoked.  This small patch series fixes two places known-affected in the 
MIPS Makefile fragment and also included a follow-up revert of an earlier 
misguided attempt.  See individual change descriptions for details.

 Verified with `decstation_64_defconfig' and `fuloong2e_defconfig' using 
`modules_install'.  Please apply.

  Maciej
