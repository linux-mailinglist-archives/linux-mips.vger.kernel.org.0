The problem with these inher—ñtances is that they don't actually work
for the general case.  You'd also need to inherity things like the
dma ranges, the bus limits, etc, etc.  So we need to kill them instead.
That whole mic/vop case is even worse than that with it's weird set
of chained dma ops that seems to implement some kind of device side
iommu that isn't in scope for the DMA API at all.
