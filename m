of_irq_get_byname() does not give you parent interrupt, but the
interrupt. Why do you need parent interrupt and what is it?

How requiring parents interrupt is related to other changes in this
file? One logical change, one patch.

Anyway why did you do it and take it by names? Names here are basically
useless if they match indices, so just get interrupt by indices.

All of them start from 0, so why do you want to allow here starting from 3?

Why DT node would not have int0? Provide proper upstreamed Linux kernel
source proving this, not some imaginary code.

You don't have this case here. I don't see any device asking for 4 regs.

The top-level defines widest constraints and if:else: narrows them per
each variant.

This is driver. You need to show the DTS, not driver.

if:else: is recommended, we do not discuss it. Your v1 was making
everything totally loose, so incorrect. Explain - why the reg-names are
not correct for the other variant? We expect just to have maxItems for
the other variant... unless reg-names are not correct, then they can be
made false - which you didn't.
