Let me make things clear and ignore those irrelevant information.
1, Our liointc controller has 32 inputs from downstream interrupt
sources and 4 outputs to the parent irqchip, the "routing" here means
which input go to which output.
2, We use 'parent_int_map' to describe the boot-time routing in dts
previously, but Krzysztof suggests us to use 'interrupt-map' instead.
3, When we rework our driver to use 'interrupt-map', we found that
this property is not supposed to be used in a regular irqchip (it is
usually used in a pcie port which is also act as an irqchip).
4, If we still want to use 'interrupt-map' to describe the routing in
liointc, we should make of_irq_parse_raw() stop at the liointc level
rather than go to its parent level, because the hwirq is provided by
liointc, not its parent. To archive this goal, we should add liointc
to the quirk list.
5, So, for our liointc driver we have two choices: 1) still use the
'parent_int_map' property; 2) use 'interrupt-map' property and add
liointc to the quirk list. We prefer the first ourselves, but
Krzysztof may give us a best solution.
