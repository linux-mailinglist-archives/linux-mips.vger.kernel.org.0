For all intents and purposes, so was nested_ops->has_events().  I don't see
any reason to have two APIs that do the same thing, and the call to
kvm_guest_apic_has_interrupt() is wrong in that it doesn't verify that IRQs=
 are
enabled for _L2_.  That's why my preference is to fold the two together.

Yeah, this is what my untested hack-a-patch tried to do.

The changelog is misleading/wrong.  Writing guest memory is ok, what isn't =
safe
is blocking or sleeping, i.e. KVM must not trigger a host page fault due to
accessing a page that's been swapped out.  Read vs. write doesn't matter.

So KVM can safely read and write guest memory so long as it already mapped =
by=20
kvm_vcpu_map() (or I suppose if we wrapped an access with pagefault_disable=
(),
but I can't think of a sane reason to do that).  E.g. nVMX can access a vCP=
U's
PID mapping, but synthesizing a nested VM-Exit will cause explosions on nSV=
M.

nested_ops->has_events() is the much better fit, e.g. the naming won't get =
weird
and we can gate the whole thing on is_guest_mode().  Though we probably nee=
d a
wrapper to handle any commonalities between nVMX and nSVM.

> What do you think? I can prepare a patch for this.

As above, this is what I tried to do, sort of.  Though it's obviously broke=
n.  We
don't need a full dry-run because KVM only needs to detect events that are =
unique
to L2, e.g. nVMX's preemption timer, MTF, and pending virtual interrupts (h=
mm,
I suspect nSVM's vNMI is broken too).  Things like INIT and SMI don't requi=
re
nested virtualization awareness because the event itself is tracked for the=
 vCPU
as a whole.
