Clever! I think you're right that it would work correctly.

This approach avoids the need for caching access bits, but comes with downsides:
 - Performance impact from the extra faults needed to drop the SP and
repair the execute permission bit.
 - Some amount of memory overhead from KVM allocating new SPs when it
could re-use existing SPs.

Given the relative simplicity of access caching (and the fact that it
requires no additional memory), I'm inclined to stick with it rather
than taking the access permissions from the huge page.
