 The settings are a bit buried indeed and I was hit by that myself at one 
point when upgrading the kernel using old .config, but honestly I think we 
want to let people strip the kernel from options they don't want or need, 
so I think it will best be sorted by presetting the useful options in the 
respective defconfigs and then maybe guard the more critical ones with `if 
EXPERT'.
