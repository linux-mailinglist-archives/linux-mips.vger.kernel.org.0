Do you mind posting your physical memory layout?

If I understand correctly, you have a hole in your RAM and there is MMIO
region somewhere in that hole. With FLATMEM the memory map exists for that
hole and hence pfn_valid() returns 1 for the MMIO range as well. That makes
__update_cache() to check folio state and that check would fail if the memory
map contained garbage. But since the hole in the memory map is initialized
with init_unavailable_range() you get a valid struct page/struct folio and
everything is fine.

With that, the init_unavailable_range() docs need not mention IO space at
all, they should mention holes within FLATMEM memory map.

As for SPARSEMEM, if the hole does not belong to any section, pfn_valid()
will be false for it and __update_cache() won't try to access memory map.
