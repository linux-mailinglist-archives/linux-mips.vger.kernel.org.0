Thanks for the reminder to go read this spec. I had forgotten to read it
after you previously mentioned it.

Yes, there was confusion on my part due to reading the code but not
discovering/reading the spec prior to now.

I think that was the reason for my confusion. I didn't understand why
AMD-TEE didn't have the same need to register memory.

I think the "not" at the end of this line should be removed, right?

I noticed a couple things wrong with this patch during testing.

The first is obviously an oversight. tee_shm_alloc() needs to be updated
to accept the TEE_SHM_PRIV or it'll throw an "invalid shm flags ..."
error.

The second issue is a little more unclear. I am testing these patches
along with a debugging patch that prints a bit of info when
optee_shm_register() or optee_shm_unregister() is called so that I can
track the (un)registrations. I built a kernel with my v4 series but with
this patch in place of my 'tee: Support kernel shm registration without
dma-buf backing' patch. I performed 10x kexec operations and then let
the system set idle for a while. After a while of sitting idle, I
noticed a couple calls to optee_shm_register() that I hadn't seen before
(and haven't seen again). It made me worried that your patch could
result in us registering shared memory that we previously weren't
registering so I decided to try to perform another kexec operation to
ensure that the two shms were properly unregistered. At this point, the
system became unresponsive and I wasn't able to get a stack trace or any
more useful information about what happened.

Unfortunately, my debugging patch was only printing the shm's virtual
address and the shm's size. The shm's size was 4096 bytes.

My current thought is that the two new/unexpected calls to
optee_shm_register() were triggered by one of the tee_shm_alloc()'s in
drivers/tee/optee/rpc.c. Neither of those shm allocations would have
been registered before your change but they both would be after your
change. I think the easy fix is to use the TEE_SHM_PRIV flag for both of
the allocations in rpc.c. Do you agree? If so, I'll make these changes
and fold this patch into my series and send out a v5.

I still can't explain why the system became unresponsive after the two
registrations...

This was a malformed patch due to this hunk. I think an empty line was
left out of the context.
