Not necessarily, e.g. terminating the VM may corrupt the VM's file system,
which is less safe, for lack of a better word, from the VM's perspective.

Hmm, but by that argument this scenario would fall into the "dangerous" part
of "bug is fatal/dangerous".  I guess my opinion is that we should set a
fairly high bar for using KVM_BUG() so that KVM can be aggressive in shutting
down.

The answer to this probably depends on the answer to the first question of
when it's appropriate to use KVM_BUG().  E.g. if we limit usage to fatal or
dangrous cases, then blocking all ioctls() is probably the right thing do do.
