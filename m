I don't know of such SoC. Looking at the comment in vsmp_init_secondary()

/* This is Malta specific: IPI,performance and timer interrupts */

there is probably some Malta board using it.

IMHO there is the problem, irq-mips-cpu.c can only do CPU irq operations
on the same CPU. I've checked MIPS MT specs and it's possible do
modify CP0 registers between VPEs. Using that needs changes in
irq-mips-cpu.c. But mabye that's not woth the effort as probably
all SMP cabable platforms have some multi processort capable
interrupt controller implemented.

I thought about another way solve the issue. By introducing a
new function in smp-mt.c which sets the value of the interrupt
mask for the secondary CPU, which is then used in vsmp_init_secondary().
Not sure if this is worth the effort compared to a .boot_secondary
override.

Crap can work. Given enough thrust pigs will fly, but it's not necessarily a
good idea.                                                [ RFC1925, 2.3 ]
