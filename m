That looks like a good idea to hide flags from users. BTW, my only
objection earlier with Tyler's and your patch-set is the usage of
TEE_SHM_REGISTER flag in generic TEE methods: tee_shm_alloc*. AFAIU,
the only reason for such an additional flag is in case of OP-TEE only
because the OP-TEE driver could implement allocated shared memory via
re-using dynamic shared memory approach as well. And that additional
flag is only needed to differentiate that OP-TEE driver's private
memory shouldn't be registered with OP-TEE. If this understanding is
correct then we should introduce a separate flag as TEE_SHM_PRIV that
should only be set inside tee_shm_alloc_anon_kernel_buf().

As otherwise passing TEE_SHM_REGISTER flag for shared memory alloc API
for other TEEs like AMD-TEE etc. would be useless.

That's the value-add in the problem that Tyler is trying to resolve
that driver should be able to free up the memory as needed as a
private buffer.

Is there any limitation for those platforms to not support dynamic
shared memory in OP-TEE? If there isn't then we should able to handle
this via match for TEE_GEN_CAP_REG_MEM in the ftpm_tee_match() and
optee_ctx_match() APIs.

I don't see any problems apart from one mentioned above.
