Ya :-/  I don't see an easy way to break it up without creating a massive diff,
e.g. it could be staged in x86 and moved to common, but I don't think that would
fundamentally change the diff.  Although I admittedly didn't spend _that_ much
time thinking about how to break it up.

Not that it matters right now, but can_block and can_yield are the same thing.
I considered s/can_yield/can_block to make it all consistent, but that felt like
unnecessary thrash.

Drat.  This made me realize that the 'struct kvm_gfn_range' passed to arch code
isn't tagged 'const'.  I thought I had done that, but obviously not.

Anyways, what I was going to say before that realization is that the downside to
putting flush into kvm_gfn_range is that it would have to lose its 'const'
qualifier.  That's all a moot point if it's not easily constified though.

Const aside, my gut reaction is that it will probably be cleaner to keep the
flush stuff in arch code, separate from the kvm_gfn_range passed in by common
KVM.  Looping 'flush' back into the helpers is x86 specific at this point, and
AFAICT that's not likely to change any time soon.

For rwlock support, if we get to the point where kvm_age_gfn() and/or
kvm_test_age_gfn() can take mmu_lock for read, then it definitely makes sense to
track locking in kvm_gfn_range, assuming it isn't the sole entity that prevents
consifying kvm_range_range.
