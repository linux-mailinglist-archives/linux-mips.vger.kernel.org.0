I'm not sure exactly what "PCI_LEGACY" above refers to.

I don't see any direct #includes of arch/mips in the driver.  I do see
that it uses mips_cps_numiocu(), which is certainly MIPS-specific.

But we do have some things in drivers/pci/controller/ that only build
on certain arches, enforced mostly by Kconfig rules, so I think you
could do that.  We try to make so things can at least be *compiled* on
any arch, but I know that's not always possible.

So I think it would be useful to put this in drivers/pci/controller/
somewhere because it will make it easier to see common patterns and
refactoring opportunities.
