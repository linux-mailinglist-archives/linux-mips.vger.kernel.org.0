Thanks for pointing out the specific function.
Maybe we do not need to warn about the case when the device has a parent,
because we must have warned about the parent if the device has a parent
and the parent also has a node of NO_NODE, so do not need to warn the child
device anymore? like blew:

@@ -932,6 +932,10 @@ static int pci_register_host_bridge(struct pci_host_bridge *bridge)
        list_add_tail(&bus->node, &pci_root_buses);
        up_write(&pci_bus_sem);

+       if (nr_node_ids > 1 && !parent &&
+           dev_to_node(bus->bridge) == NUMA_NO_NODE)
+               dev_err(bus->bridge, FW_BUG "No node assigned on NUMA capable HW. Please contact your vendor for updates.\n");
+
        return 0;


Also, we do not need to warn about that in pci_device_add(), Right?
Because we must have warned about the pci host bridge of the pci device.

I may be wrong about above because I am not so familiar with the pci.

Thanks.
Will do that on per-bus-type basis.
