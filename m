This effectively is per-slot TLB flushing, it just has a different name.
I.e. s/kvm_arch_dirty_log_tlb_flush/kvm_arch_flush_remote_tlbs_memslot.
I'm not opposed to that name change.  And on second and third glance, I
probably prefer it.  That would more or less follow the naming of
kvm_arch_flush_shadow_all() and kvm_arch_flush_shadow_memslot().

I don't want to go straight to kvm_arch_flush_remote_tlb_with_address()
because that loses the important distinction (on x86) that slots_lock is
expected to be held.
