Excellent, thank you! I understand what is going on here and your patch
should work to resolve it (although I think the commit message should be
flushed out a little more with the following details) but I am curious
if Masahiro has any thoughts around this.

As you note, the error message comes from the CHECKFLAGS invocation of
$(CC) but it has no impact on the final result of modules_install, it is
purely a cosmetic issue from what I can tell. The error occurs because
cc-option is defined in scripts/Makefile.compiler, which is not included
in Makefile when running modules_install, as install targets are not
supposed to require the compiler; see commit 805b2e1d427a ("kbuild:
include Makefile.compiler only when compiler is needed"). As a result,
the call to check for '-mno-loongson-mmi' just never happens.

It would nice if '-mno-loongson-mmi' could be added unconditionally when
using GCC but I can see that the flag has only existed since 9.x, so we
do need to keep the cc-option call.

I am fine with your change as long as it includes some of the above
information (basically noting that while the original change should have
been equivalent, the requirement of '-mno-loongson-mmi' when using
certain Loongson '-march=' values with '-msoft-float' means that those
Loongson '-march=' values need to be called with cc-option as well),
even if clang will incur two more cc-option calls as a result (not the
end of the world).

Additionally, it seems like the same issue will occur when running
modules_install when CONFIG_CPU_LOONGSON2E or CONFIG_CPU_LOONGSON2F are
enabled, which I guess I also broke in commit 13ceb48bc19c ("MIPS:
Loongson2ef: Remove unnecessary {as,cc}-option calls") :/

Sorry again for the breakage and thanks for the fix!

Cheers,
Nathan
