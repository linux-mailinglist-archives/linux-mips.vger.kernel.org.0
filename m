The descriptors will cause it to be set when the peripheral is enabled, as far 
as I can tell.

It may be set in various versions of the Linux driver, but my observation was 
that in a non-Linux environment where nothing else is setting anything in the 
register concerned, initialising the descriptors seems to enable OSD and the 
OSD alpha enable bit.

Yesterday, I did consider what might be done to avoid the alpha bit being set, 
but I didn't immediately see anything in the descriptor fields that would 
offer such an alternative. The bit in question seems to be a global alpha 
enable setting, and so choosing per-pixel alpha would probably also result in 
it being set, although I didn't fire up the CI20 to check.
