I should have looked closer here - I was thinking about the return value
of rcuwait_wait_event. Yes, that signal_pending check you mention makes
the sleep semantics change bogus as interruptible is no longer just to
avoid contributing to the load balance.

And yes, unfortunately adding prepare_to and finish_rcuwait() looks like the
most reasonable approach to keeping the tracepoint semantics. I also considered
extending rcuwait_wait_event() by another parameter to pass back to the caller
if there was any wait at all, but that enlarges the call and is probably less
generic.

I'll send another version keeping the current sleep and tracepoint semantics.

Thanks,
Davidlohr
