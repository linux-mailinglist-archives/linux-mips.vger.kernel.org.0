No, actually shared memory allocated for OP-TEE driver internal usage
didn't enable this flag while in all other invocations TEE_SHM_DMA_BUF
is enabled as the driver's private shared memory isn't required to be
registered with OP-TEE.

Yeah you are right. Apologies for my oversight as this patch was
compile tested only.

Agree.

Yeah I agree, please use TEE_SHM_PRIV for private shm allocations in
drivers/tee/optee/rpc.c as well.

Probably the two registrations created a cyclic loop and cores got
hung in there.
