For me it would make sense to not mix this patch which implement tests, 
and changes that are needed for the test to work (or even build) on the 
different architectures.

But that's up to you.

I can't see any debug related features in that file.

What about linux/mmdebug.h instead ? (I have not checked if it would 
reduce the impact, but that's where things related to CONFIG_DEBUG_VM 
seems to be).

Otherwise, you can just create new file, for instance 
<linux/mmdebug-pgtable.h> and include that file only in the init/main.c 
and mm/debug_vm_pgtable.c

Yes, but how can we improve if we blindly copy the errors from the past 
? Having tons of 'extern' doesn't mean we must add more.

I think checkpatch.pl usually complains when a patch brings a new 
unreleval extern symbol.

It would avoid having it lost in the middle of drivers logs, would be 
close to the end of init, at a place we can't miss it, close to the 
result of other tests like CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA_TEST for instance.

At the moment, you have to look for it to be sure the test is done and 
what the result is.

Yes but it perfectly work as standalone. The more easy it is to activate 
and the more people will use it. DEBUG_VM obliges to rebuild the kernel 
entirely and could modify the behaviour. Could the helpers we are 
testing behave differently when DEBUG_VM is not set ? I think it's good 
the test things as close as possible to final config.

I think if we want people to really use it on other architectures it 
must be possible to activate it without having to modify Kconfig. 
Otherwise people won't even know the test exists and the architecture 
fails the test.

The purpose of a test suite is to detect bugs. If you can't run the test 
until you have fixed the bugs, I guess nobody will ever detect the bugs 
and they will never be fixed.

So I think:
- the test should be 'default y' when ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE is selected
- the test should be 'default n' when ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE is not 
selected, and it should be user selectable if EXPERT is selected.

Something like:

config DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE
     bool "Debug arch page table for semantics compliance" if 
ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE || EXPERT
     depends on MMU
     default 'n' if !ARCH_HAS_DEBUG_VM_PGTABLE
     default 'y' if DEBUG_VM

Well I was not asking if 'default y' was making sense but only if 'If 
unsure say N' was making sense due to the 'default y'. You got it.
