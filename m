 There's nothing to implement as the MIPS port has supported arbitrary 
memory maps since Dec 11th, 2000; that's almost 22 years now.  C.f.: 
<https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mips/Pine.GSO.3.96.1000814133957.7256S-100000@delta.ds2.pg.gda.pl/>, 
<https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ralf/linux.git/commit/?id=97b7ae4257ef>.

 Sadly commit a09fc446fb6d ("[MIPS] setup.c: use early_param() for early 
command line parsing") removed last pieces of inline documentation; I 
don't know why things like that get approved, but neither I can take 
responsibility.

 Also to say (in said commit):

"There's no point to rewrite some logic to parse command line
to pass initrd parameters or to declare a user memory area.
We could use instead parse_early_param() that does the same
thing."

is IMHO unfair given that the "rewrite" was there in place almost six 
years before `parse_early_param' even started to exist!  Why do people 
assume things have always been like they see them at the time they look?
