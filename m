I see. I had made the mistake myself to not check for NULL pointer on
regulator_disable here...

The question may be how we can know for a more generic driver that there =
is always a regulator.
In the present case we know the schematics but it is just one example.

Indeed. So let's modify it as you have suggested.

BR and thanks,
