Hello Maciej! Thank you very much for the explanation!

Now it makes sense and looks like that for GT-64111 it is "system
erratum" that strapping pins are incorrectly set which leads to wrong
PCI class code.

I will update comment for GT-64111 quirk in v2.

I'm surprised that Marvell copied this 20 years old MIPS Galileo PCI
logic into followup ARM SoC PCIe IPs (and later also into recent ARM64
A3720 SoC PCIe IP), removed configuration of PCI class code via
strapping pins and let default PCI class code value to Memory device,
even also when PCIe controller is running in Root Complex mode. And so
correction can be done only from "CPU bus".

Just Marvell forgot to include chapter about usage without CPU interface
in new ARM and ARM64 SoCs and origin/usage of that Memory Controller
Device was lost in history, even Marvell people was not able to figure
out what was wrong with PCIe IP in their ARM SoCs...

Maciej, if I had known that you have this kind of information I would
have written you year ago :-)
