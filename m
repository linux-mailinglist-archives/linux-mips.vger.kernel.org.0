Aha!  I suspected that might be the case.

TDX and SNP also need to solve the same problem of "reclaiming" memory before it
can be safely accessed by the host.  The plan is to add an arch hook (or two?)
into guest_memfd that is invoked when memory is freed from guest_memfd.

Hooking kvm_arch_guest_memory_reclaimed() isn't completely correct as deleting a
memslot doesn't *guarantee* that guest memory is actually reclaimed (which reminds
me, we need to figure out a better name for that thing before introducing
kvm_arch_gmem_invalidate()).

The effective false positives aren't fatal for the current usage because the hook
is used only for x86 SEV guests to flush caches.  An unnecessary flush can cause
performance issues, but it doesn't affect correctness. For TDX and SNP, and IIUC
pKVM, false positives are fatal because KVM could assign memory back to the host
that is still owned by guest_memfd.

E.g. a misbehaving userspace could prematurely delete a memslot.  And the more
fun example is intrahost migration, where the plan is to allow pointing multiple
guest_memfd files at a single guest_memfd inode:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1691446946.git.ackerleytng@google.com

There was a lot of discussion for this, but it's scattered all over the place.
The TL;DR is is that the inode will represent physical memory, and a file will
represent a given "struct kvm" instance's view of that memory.  And so the memory
isn't reclaimed until the inode is truncated/punched.

I _think_ this reflects the most recent plan from the guest_memfd side:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/1233d749211c08d51f9ca5d427938d47f008af1f.1689893403.git.isaku.yamahata@intel.com
