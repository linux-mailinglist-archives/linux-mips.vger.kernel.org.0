Hi Bibo,
Thanks for your response.

+ Xing Li as I heard he is in charge of KVM from Loongson's news post.

I'm planing to use DeviceTree to pass device information between QEMU
and guest kernel. So we can upgrade VM design at any moment without
breaking Host Guest kernel compatibility.

gpex is basically a pci-host-cam-generic at kernel point of view. I'm
planing to reuse it too.

Yes, APIC from x86 and GIC from Arm are all bonded closely with their
architecture so we can't reuse them. Probably what we need is a
modified version of EXTIOI from Loongson-3A4000.

Does Loongson have a plan to implement hardware virtual irqchip? If so
we must align with it's design.

My plan is we can firstly implement a very simple IRQCHIP instead of
complex one which only handle UART and PCI INTx. That is enough to make
the system work. After that we can sit and discuss how to implement a
complicated version to archive more features.
