I don't know why the windows are managed that way.  That was added by
37d6a0a6f470 ("PCI: Add pci_register_host_bridge() interface").   I
cc'd Arnd just in case he remembers, but that was a long time ago.

I don't see any use of bridge->windows in any of the
pcibios_root_bridge_prepare() functions.  It doesn't *look* like it
should be used until the coalesce/add code near the end.
