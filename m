I have found on internet some copy of GT64111 datasheet ("GT-64111
System Controller for RC4640, RM523X and VR4300 CPUs", Galileo
Technology, Product Preview Revision 1.1, FEB 4, 1999) and in section
"17.15 PCI Configuration Registers" there is subsection "Class Code and
Revision ID, Offset: 0x008" with content:

Bits  Field name Function                                           Initial Value
7:0   RevID      Indicates the GT-64111 Revision number.            0x10
                 GT-64111-P-0 = 0x10
15:8  Reserved                                                      0x0
23:16 SubClass   Indicates the GT-64111 Subclass (0x80 - other mem- 0x80
                 ory controller)
31:24 BaseClass  Indicates the GT-64111 Base Class (0x5 - memory    0x05
                 controller).

And in section "6.5.3 PCI Autoconfiguration at RESET" is following
interesting information:

Eight PCI registers can be automatically loaded after Rst*.
Autoconfiguration mode is enabled by asserting the DMAReq[3]* LOW on
Rst*. Any PCI transactions targeted for the GT-64111 will be retried
while the loading of the PCI configuration registers is in process.

It is highly recommended that all PC applications utilize the PCI
Autoconfiguration at RESET feature. The autoload feature can be easily
implemented with a very low cost EPLD. Galileo provides sample EPLD
equations upon request. (You can always pull the EPLD off your final
product if you find there are no issues during testing.)

NOTE: The GT-64111’s default Class Code is 0x0580 (Memory Controller)
which is a change from the GT-64011.

The GT-64011 used the Class Code 0x0600 which denotes Host Bridge. Some
PCs refuse to configure host bridges if they are found plugged into a
PCI slot (ask the BIOS vendors why...). The “Memory Controller” Class
Code does not cause a problem for these non-compliant BIOSes, so we used
this as the default in the GT-64111. The Class Code can be reporgrammed
in both devices via autoload or CPU register writes.

The PCI register values are loaded from the ROM controlled by BootCS*
are shown in Table 21, below.

TABLE 21. PCI Registers Loaded at RESET
Register                        Offset Boot Device Address
Device and Vendor ID            0x000  0x1fffffe0
Class Code and Revision ID      0x008  0x1fffffe4
Subsystem Device and Vendor ID  0x02c  0x1fffffe8
Interrupt Pin and Line          0x03c  0x1fffffec
RAS[1:0]* Bank Size             0xc08  0x1ffffff0
RAS[3:2]* Bank Size             0xc0c  0x1ffffff4
CS[2:0]* Bank Size              0xc10  0x1ffffff8
CS[3]* & Boot CS* Bank Size     0xc14  0x1ffffffc

===

So the conclusion is that there is also some RESET configuration via
BootCS (I have no idea what it is or was). And default value (when RESET
configuration is not used) is always "Memory controller" due to
existence of "broken PC BIOSes" (probably x86).

Hence the quirk for GT64111 in kernel is always needed. And Thomas
already confirmed in his pci hexdump that PCI Class code is set to
Memory Controller.

I hope that now this mystery of this GT64111 quirk is solved :-) I will
update patch with correct comment, why quirk is needed.

So due to the fact that 20 years ago there were broken x86 BIOSes which
did not like PCI devices with PCI Class code of Host Bridge, Marvell
changed default PCI Class code to Memory Controller and let it in this
state also for future PCIe-based ARM and AR64 SoCs for next 20 years.
Which generally leaded to broken PCIe support in mvebu SoCs. I have no
more comments about it... :-(
