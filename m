Hi Luca

Yeah, it was a nightmare fixing that weird problem. Thanks god you
have committed the solution. Last time I had to face something similar
was when I was fixing a problem in the IDT NTB controller, which caused
PCIe MRd TLPs successfully passed from one side to another, but not in
the opposite direction. I spent months trying to figure out the root
cause of the problem or at least find some workaround. I wrote several
messages to the support team but for some reason they didn't respond.
After all the struggle I've found the IDT PCIe bridges configuration
tool, hacked it's XML config files where I found the info regarding the
Vendor-specific PCIe config-space undocumented flags. It turned out that
by default the controller discarded the PCIe MRd responses coming from
the link-partner with non-zero device number. In order to make things
working a vendor-specific flag needed to be set.

Thanks. I'll use the top one then since it was used in the patch
Author tag.
