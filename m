That's with the assymetric capacity thing, weird to be separate.

So while I like the idea of an overview; this isn't one. An overview is
where we list current features, and explain (in short) why and what.

Write it like you want to read this as a text document. Ignore all that

Also, your terminology is ambiguous, what is a core?

The whole priorities thing is a mess; and you've missed some of it. -1
is actually the highest (static) priority. But even that doesn't
adequately describe things, since we have a dynamic priority scheduling
class these days.

Most everything that looks at the static priority of tasks these days;
and doesn't:

 - use it to distinguish classes
 - is the RR/FIFO static priority scheduler

is doing it wrong. Yes we have heaps of legacy, but it's not a main
feature anymore. Slowly but surely the ->prio field becomes less and
less relevant.

The fair class uses the static priority field to encode the nice level,
but is nice a priority? I think not.

1, 2, many, right? ;-) _5_ is the number: stop, deadline, rt, fair,
idle.

policy enumeration:

SCHED_DEADLINE goes here..

They're both a static priority scheduling class. They're the only ones
for which the term priority actually has a sane meaning.

> +while SCHED_NORMAL and SCHED_BATCH policies handle tasks with normal priorities.

What's an abnormal priority? Both these are weighted proportionally fair
and encode the weight, as nice value, in the prio field, in a range not
overlapping the static prio range. But that doesn't make it a priority.

Priority for SCHED_IDLE is meaningless, the only reason it 'has' one is
so that code that looks to do a prio->class mapping works.

This.

Tada, you did find the -1!

Ah, so you do want to treat those too; so perhaps then present it like a
double iteration:

 - stop_class:

 - dl_class:

   * SCHED_DEADLINE:

 - rt_class

   * SCHED_RR / SCHED_FIFO:

 - fair_class:

   * SCHED_NORMAL/SCHED_BATCH:
   * SCHED_IDLE:

 - idle_class:

That's far easier to read than a blob of words.

Priority for idle task is irrelevant, if they have a prio it is purely
by accident. Looking at ->prio for idle task would be a stright bug.
The "swapper" name is a historical accident. We do not in fact swap from
it.

Really? I thought we exposed it as a FIFO-99 (userpsace 99, not kernel
99) task. Then again, I haven't actually looked at it recently. The
reason we disguise it is to present a 'known' class to userspace, to
avoid growing the ABI for this.

return to this task; obviously the system keeps running so it must do
something.

Perhaps its clearer to state that the task will never be ran again.

nr_cpus_allowed it not a bitfield, it is the hamming weight of a

Perhaps add a warning that direct manipulation of TIF_NEED_RESCHED is
unwise. You make it sound like a simple thing -- which I understand from
the PoV of explaining how it sort-of works, but might give people the
wrong impression.

It might be less confusing if you classify those:

 - blocking operations:

   * mutex_lock() / wait_event() / etc..

 - co-operative / voluntary preemption:

   * cond_resched*()
   * yield()
   * preempt_enable()

 - involuntary preemption:

   * scheduler_tick()
   * wake_up_process()

The blocking oeprations will suspend the current task and directly call
into the scheduler to find something else to do.

The co-operative/voluntary crud will allow another task to run at that
point (subject to preemption model).

The involuntary preemption things will mark TIF_NEED_RESCHED and wait
for action (again depending on preemption model).

I so hate that rst crap; John, can't we teach the thing that anything
called 'struct foo' or 'foo_t' is in fact a C type, just like we did
with foo() being a function?

You started an enumeration with ':' above, but have no bullet here,
perhaps:

 - sched_class::enqueue_task()

or somesuch?

implies set_next_task() having been called on the task returned.

(the core-sched patches have some variants here, just in case you're
curious)

This isn't a general API and should not have the kerneldoc on. Put it on

OMG... I suppose I appreciate the effort, but that's unwieldy and 100%
likely to get bitrotten real quick.

Also, rq really isn't an exported API. So perhaps, if you really feel
the need, expand the comment on some of the fields inside the structure,
but I don't see this as anything other than a giant blob to ignore.
