Maybe I'm not getting this right, but as I understand vsmp_init_secondary()=
 is
run on VPE1, changing the local c0_status on that VPE. When unmask_mips_irq=
() is
called from code running on VPE1, I would expect it does the same thing: en=
able
the requested irq on VPE1 by modifying the local c0_status register.

Since these IRQs can be configured VPE, aren't these then also per-cpu
interrupts? I have been wondering if a cascaded IRQ controller needs to tak=
e
special care with such per-cpu interrupts, but haven't been able to figure =
that
out until now.

Sorry if the above doesn't make much sense, but like Aleksander I've been
struggling with this and would like to understand what the proper solution =
is.

Best,
Sander
