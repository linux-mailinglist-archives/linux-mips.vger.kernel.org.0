Sorry, but the second warning is obvious. It really does not bring any
information and better to keep things simple and concise. Concise helps
to read/understand the commit.

Good, but it's not everything. DTS is a description of hardware and we
might want to have the extended description, e.g. with clock-names.

You should always doubt, knowing how incompletely or poorly bindings
were written or converted (including the ones I was doing myself).

Which is not everything. DTS might be used in other projects - did you
test them as well?
