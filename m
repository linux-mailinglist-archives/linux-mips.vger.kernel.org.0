This is all ok for me, Bjorn. Thanks for doing this. I guess even if
we don't force people to a DT update to synchronize things, since
bindings have been changed until they have been approved, I guess most
people must upgrade from early not approved DT early versions in any
case. But in any case I guess that maintaining the compatible string
is the safest thing to do.
