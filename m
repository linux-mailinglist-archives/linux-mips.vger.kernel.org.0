 No offence taken; I just wanted to make it absolutely clear what the 
situation currently is.

 That's subject to the probability theory and depending on what people's 
usage models are.

 You seem the most severely affected so far, so why not act in your best 
interest?  I think option #2 applies here and seems quite straightforward 
to follow, referring commit 2bc5bab9a763 and using your use case as the 
justification.  It doesn't have to be the author to request a backport.

 NB I think it has to be backported to all the stable branches made since 
the original breakage; i.e. v5.9+ (I haven't kept track of what they are).
