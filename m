Even if for some architecture the only common thing are the permissions,
having a definition for code allocations in a single place an improvement.
The diffstat of the patches is indeed positive (even without comments), but
having a single structure that specifies how the code should be allocated
would IMHO actually reduce the maintenance burden.

And features like caching of large pages and sub-page size allocations are
surely will be easier to opt-in this way.

I've looked into doing this like a kmem_cache with call sites passing the
allocator data, and this gets really hairy. For each user we need to pass
the arch specific parameters to that user, create a cache there and only
then the cache can be used. Since we don't have hooks to setup any of the
users in the arch code, the initialization gets more complex than shoving
everything into an array.

I think that jit_alloc(type, size) is the best way to move forward to let
different users choose their ranges and potentially caches. Differentiation
by the API name will explode even now and it'll get worse if/when new users
will show up and we can't even force users to avoid using PC-relative
addressing because, e.g. RISC-V explicitly switched their BPF JIT to use
that.
