What are the values in the BARs?  Do they look like addresses?  Would
they make sense in the iomem_resource, i.e., in /proc/iomem?

If the BARs contain addresses of devices, the kernel needs to avoid
that address space when allocating space for other devices.  But
without probing the BARs, the kernel has no idea what the *size* of
the regions is.  Does the manual say anything about that?

Can you tell if there's anything at all Linux could do with these
devices?  If they don't have BARs and they don't document any
device-specific registers in config space, there's not much value in
treating them like PCI devices at all.

I wonder if we should just make a way to completely ignore them, e.g.,
a way for pci_setup_device() to return an error.   I guess we *could*
do that already by making your early fixup set dev->hdr_type to 0xff
or something.
