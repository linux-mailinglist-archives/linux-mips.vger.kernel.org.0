Originally I was thinking about that, but then in order to minimize
the properties validation I've decided to split the properties in
accordance with the USB controllers functionality:

            +----- USB Gadget/Peripheral Controller. There is no
            |      specific schema for the gadgets since there is no
            |      common gadget properties (at least I failed to find
            |      ones). So the pure gadget controllers need to be
            |      validated just against usb.yaml schema.
            |
usb.yaml <--+-- usb-hcd.yaml - Generic USB Host Controller. The schema
                ^              turns out to include the OHCI/UHCI/EHCI
                |              properties, which AFAICS are also
                |              applicable for the other host controllers.
                |              So any USB host controller node needs to
                |              be validated against this schema.
                |
                +- usb-xhci.yaml - Generic xHCI Host controller.

usb-drd.yaml -- USB Dual-Role/OTG Controllers. It describes the
                DRD/OTG-specific properties and nothing else. So normally
                it should be applied together with one of the
                schemas described above.

So the use-cases of the suggested schemas is following:

1) USB Controller is pure gadget? Then:
   + allOf:
   +  - $ref: usb.yaml#
2) USB Controller is pure USB host (including OHCI/UHCI/EHCI)?
   + allOf:
   +   - $ref: usb-hcd.yaml#
   Note this prevents us from fixing all the currently available USB DT
   schemas, which already apply the usb-hcd.yaml schema.
3) USB Controller is pure xHCI host controller? Then:
   + allOf:
   +   - $ref: usb-xhci.yaml#
4) USB Controller is Dual-Role/OTG controller with USB 2.0 host? Then:
   + allOf:
   +   - $ref: usb-drd.yaml#
   +   - $ref: usb-hcd.yaml#
5) USB Controller is Dual-Role/OTG controller with xHCI host? Then:
   + allOf:
   +   - $ref: usb-drd.yaml#
   +   - $ref: usb-xhci.yaml#
6) USB Controller is Dual-Role/OTG controller which can only be a
   gadget? Then:
   + allOf:
   +   - $ref: usb-drd.yaml#
   +   - $ref: usb.yaml#

* Don't know really if controllers like in 6)-th really exist. Most
* likely they are still internally capable of dual-roling, but due to
* some conditions can be used as gadgets only.

It looks a bit complicated, but at least by having such design we'd minimize
the number of properties validation.

Alternatively we could implement a hierarchy like this (as you, Rob,
suggested in the comment above): 

            +-- USB Gadget/Peripheral Controller
            |
            +-- usb-drd.yaml - USB Dual-Role/OTG Controllers
            |   
usb.yaml <--+-- usb-dcd.yaml - Generic USB Host Controller
                ^
                |
                +- usb-xhci.yaml - Generic xHCI Host controller

But, for instance, if we got to have an OTG controller with USB 2.0
host capability, the schema would have needed to be validated as
described in 4) in the list above. That would have caused the usb.yaml
schema validation twice.

Of course I could have missed or misunderstood something. So any
suggestion, any help with making things easier would be very
appreciated. I asked Greg what he was thinking in this matter in
the previous patchset thread, but he didn't respond.

Theoretically it's possible, but I don't really know whether it can be
practically met. Of course I fully agree with you and it's preferable to
simplify the schema by getting rid of the condition if it's possible.

My point of using the conditional schema here has been based
on the driver implementation. According to the driver code if OTG mode is
enabled by means of the dr_mode property, then the controller can work as
either host or gadget. If either host or gadget mode is enabled in
the dr_mode property, the mode updating won't be supported. So any
properties specific to the unsupported mode will be just ignored.

In addition to that DWC USB3 IP-core can be synthesized with different
DWC_USB3_MODE parameter value. The controller can be either device
(gadget), or host, or DRD, or HUB. In that case the dr_mode should be
set in accordance with that parameter value. It means that the
DWC USB3 controller will support the features in accordance with the
selected parameter.

Should we really bother with all of that? Could we just apply the
schema like: allOf: [$ref: usb-drd.yaml#, $ref: usb-hcd.yaml#] and
have the things much easier seeing the host-specific properties aren't
required anyway? That's the main question. I've decided to bother,
since it give us a better hardware description. If you think it's better
to keep things easier, I'll be ok with this. It won't be that
contradicting to the hardware capabilities after all.
