Not sure what you mean?  The API is about providing a piece of 
information independent of the architecture, while catering for a ppc 
weirdness.  Yes it's mostly useless if you don't care about ppc, but 
it's not about making arm64 look like x86 or ppc; it's about not having 
to special case ppc in userspace.

If anything, if KVM_CAP_NR_VCPUS returns the same for kvm and !kvm, then 
*that* is making an arm64 box look like an x86.  On ARM the max vCPUs 
depends on VM's GIC configuration, so KVM_CAP_NR_VCPUS should take that 
into account.  Or KVM_CAP_NR_VCPUS should have been only for !kvm; but 
the ship for that has sailed.
