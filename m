Paolo, can you please give us some guidance on integration of this
series, and on future workflow?

Since, the reality is, you are the most experienced between us on
these topics, so you know what is the optimal organization. I gather,
it is very important for us in KVM/MIPS to adopt the efficient and
no-nonsens practices, that you know how to choose the best.

I truly appreciate any future response of yours!

Aleksandar
