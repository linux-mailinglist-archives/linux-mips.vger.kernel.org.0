Hm, is the above about the result with the pointer callback returning
pos, not nextpos?  If so,

At this moment, nextpos is 1024, and it should take some time until

... this IRQ is triggered; it must be the period time.
Was the reported timing as expected?

If it's the first IRQ, isn't the nextpos 2048?

It's stopped likely because the position reported the driver is beyond
the data size the application filled (XRUN).

The hw constraint can be just a function that filters the min/max
value the driver may accept, so such a rule is possible.

The implementation became a bit complex due to the hardware
restriction, yeah.
