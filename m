Hi Mike, Thomas and Maciej,

Thank you very much for your feedbacks and discussions.

To be frank, I think mem= and memmap= are used for debugging and testing
in most cases, the intention of this patchset is to refactor the related
code to make them work well on mips.

Now, if put the current patch #2 as the first patch, and then modify the
current patch #1 to support both mem=limit and mem=limit@base (if @base
is omitted, it is equivalent to mem=limit), the other patches #3 and #4
remain unchanged, make sense?

I will send v5 for your review.

Thanks,
Tiezhu
