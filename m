Heh, I still think it's nasty.

Updating mmu_notifier_count requires taking mmu_lock, which would defeat the
purpose of these shenanigans.  I think it could be made atomic, since mmu_lock
would be taken before the elevated count _must_ be visible, but that would
break the mmu_notifier_range_{start,end} optimization that was recently added.

Or did I completely misunderstand what you're suggesting?

Note, will update docs.

It's not the cost, it's that mmu_notifier_slots_lock doesn't exist.  That's an
easily solved problem, but then the lock wouldn't be initialized since
kvm_init_mmu_notifier() is a nop.  That's again easy to solve, but IMO would
look rather weird.  I guess the counter argument is that __kvm_memslots()
wouldn't need #ifdeffery.

These are the to ideas I've come up with:

Option 1:
	static int kvm_init_mmu_notifier(struct kvm *kvm)
	{
		init_rwsem(&kvm->mmu_notifier_slots_lock);

	#if defined(CONFIG_MMU_NOTIFIER) && defined(KVM_ARCH_WANT_MMU_NOTIFIER)
		kvm->mmu_notifier.ops = &kvm_mmu_notifier_ops;
		return mmu_notifier_register(&kvm->mmu_notifier, current->mm);
	#else
		return 0;
	#endif
	}


Option 2:
	kvm_mmu_notifier_lock(kvm);
	rcu_assign_pointer(kvm->memslots[as_id], slots);
	kvm_mmu_notifier_unlock(kvm);
