This is exactly the case here because the system does not have contiguous
RAM:

  [    0.000000] Early memory node ranges
  [    0.000000]   node   0: [mem 0x0000000004000000-0x000000000effffff]
  [    0.000000]   node   0: [mem 0x0000000090200000-0x00000000ffffffff]
  [    0.000000]   node   0: [mem 0x0000000120000000-0x00000001653fffff]

(from patch 3/4 in this series)

I don't see what "bug" this patch is trying to fix. Is indeed possible to
make MIPS' mem= behave like it does not arm64 and ppc, but that would break
systems that use current semantics and I recall seeing some of OpenWRT
machines using mem= to override memory map supplied by firmware.
