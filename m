Ah, ok. Now I see. I was just focussed on this patch and related =
dtbscheck
messages and did not read patch 2/2.

Yes, looking at both, they are variant c). Sorry that I didn't see it =

As said: I am open to anything as long as the dtbscheck doesn't complain =
any more.

BR and sorry for the confusion,
Nikolaus
