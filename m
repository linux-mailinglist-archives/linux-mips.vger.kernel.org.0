It should be PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT, yes.

AFAIK hugepages still don't work as-is on 32-bit as we are running out 
of available bits in PTEs. I do have hugepages enabled on a kernel 
build, but I have to manually disable ARCH_HAS_PTE_SPECIAL and 
CPU_HAS_RIXI to free up space. This is annoying but not something that 
can be fixed easily.
