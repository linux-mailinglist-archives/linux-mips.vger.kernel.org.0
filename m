Maybe it's better to add a new encoding to mem= that will have the semantics
of limiting amount of memory?

E.g.

mem=384M@

would mean "only use 384M of memory that firmware reported" while

mem=384M would mean "set memory to 0 - 384M" as it does now.

I think it's fine to have this MIPS specific because there is anyway no
consistency among architectures in mem= handling.
