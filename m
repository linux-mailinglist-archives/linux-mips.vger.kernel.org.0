The LS7A1000 north bridge chip has dedicated video RAM, but the DC in LS7A1000
can also scanout from the system memory directly like a display controller in a
SoC does. In fact, this display controller is envolved from early product of
Loongson 2H SoC. This driver still works even if the downstream PC board
manufacturer doesn't solder a video RAM on the mother board.

The lsdc_should_vram_helper_based() function in lsdc_drv.c will examine
if the DC device node contain a use_vram_helper property at driver loading time.
If there is no use_vram_helper property, CMA helper based DRM driver will be used.
Doing this way allow the user using "lsdc.use_vram_helper=0" override the default
behavior even through there is a "use_vram_helper;" property in the DTS.

In short, It is intend to let the command line passed from kernel has higher
priority than the device tree. Otherwise the end user can not switch different
driver mode through the kernel command line once the DC device node contain
"use_vram_helper;" property.

This driver's author already made the decision by the time when the patch is
sent out, even through this**may not proper.

The CMA helper based driver will be used by default, if the DC device node contain
"use_vram_helper;" then VRAM based driver will be used. This is my initial intention.
