I did a quick test with an IP30:

after that it's dead (it doesn't have memory starting at 0x0).
Most SGI systems will act broken with mem= in one way or another.
And I already had the need to limit the amount of memory.

I'm thinking about a CONFIG option, which isn't user selectable, but
selected via Kconfig only. But that would give to differents semantics
for mem=

So can I just limit amount of memory without interfering with normal
memory detection ?

Crap can work. Given enough thrust pigs will fly, but it's not necessarily a
good idea.                                                [ RFC1925, 2.3 ]
