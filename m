It is a good job to add kvm virtualization support on loongson64 platform. I agree that we should define common virt machine hardware system, however the compiled kernel binary should be the same with host system, else it will bring out trouble for customers to differentiate them between guest system and host system.

For pci host bridge emulation, I suggest that gpex pcie host bridge should be used, since it supports pcie hotplug and arm/riscv uses this pcie host bridge.

For virtual interrupt controller, it should support MSI/MSIX interrupt, irqchip in kernel, IRQFD, vhost/vfio etc. I have no idea how to define virtual interrupt controller now.
