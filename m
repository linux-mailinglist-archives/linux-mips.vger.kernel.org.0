Folks,

It appears our corporate email server changes the Message-Id field of 
messages passing through it. Due to that the emails threading gets to be
broken. I'll resubmit the properly structured v2 patchset as soon as our system
administrator fixes the problem. Sorry for the inconvenience caused by it.

Regards,
-Sergey
