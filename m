 FWIW I don't understand what the issue is here beyond that we have a bug 
that causes a system to hang when "mem=3G" is passed on the kernel command 
line.  That is assuming that system does have contiguous RAM available for 
the kernel to use from address 0 up to 3GiB; otherwise it's a user error 
to tell the kernel it has that memory available (I did get bitten by that 
myself too): garbage in, garbage out.

 I think having a CONFIG option automatically selected to disable the 
ability to give a memory map override would handicap people in debugging 
their systems or working around firmware bugs, so I would rather be 
against it.
