 Do they actually use the CP0 timer as a clock event device?  Do they have 
an alternative high-precision timer available?

 In the course of verifying this change I have noticed my DECstation
5000/260, which has a high-precision timer in the chipset available as a 
clock source device, does register the CP0 timer as a clock source device 
regardless.  Upon a closer inspection I have noticed that the CP0 timer 
interrupt is non-functional in this machine, which I have then confirmed 
as a valid CPU hardware configuration via the TimIntDis/TimerIntDis (the 
R4k CPU manual is inconsistent in naming here) boot-mode bit.  It allows 
IP7 to be used as an external interrupt source instead.  I used not to be 
aware of the presence of this boot-mode bit.

 I find this arrangement odd, because IP7 used to be wired internally as 
the FPU interrupt with the 5000/240's CPU module, so it's not usable as an 
external interrupt anyway with this system's mainboard.

 That means however that this machine (and possibly the 5000/150 as well, 
but I'll have to verify that once I get at the KN04 CPU module I have in a 
drawer at my other place) can use the CP0 timer as a clock source device 
unconditionally.  I think this discovery asks for code optimisation, which 
I'll try to cook up sometime.

 I don't expect the IP22 to have a similar arrangement with the CP0 timer 
interrupt given that the CPU was an in-house design at SGI, but who knows?  
Do you?

  Maciej
