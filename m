I had another approach in mind in "[PATCH 0/7] tee: shared memory updates",
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210609102324.2222332-1-jens.wiklander@linaro.org/

The flags needed by tee_shm_alloc() and tee_shm_register() aren't
very intuitive and in fact only accept quite few combinations. So my
idea was to hide those flags from callers outside of the TEE subsystem
with tee_shm_alloc_kernel_buf().

The approach with tee_shm_register() you suggest above has the drawback
that the TEE driver is forced to be able to handle any kernel memory.
This is OK with OP-TEE and dynamic shared memory enabled, but there are
platforms where dynamic shared memory isn't enabled. In those case must
the memory be allocated from a special pool.

Do you see any problem with instead replacing tee_shm_alloc()
with tee_shm_alloc_kernel_buf()?

Cheers,
Jens
