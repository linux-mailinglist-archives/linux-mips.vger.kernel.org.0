I would strongly be in favor of discarding the shadow paging residue if
x86 folks are willing to part ways with it :)

As it relates to guest memory management I don't see much of an issue
with it, TBH. It is sufficiently arch-generic and gets the point across.

Beyond that I think it really depends on the scope of the common code.

To replace the arm64 table walkers we will need to use it for stage-1
tables. I'm only hand-waving at the cover letter and need to do more
reading, but is it possible to accomplish some division:

 - A set of generic table walkers that implement common operations, like
   map and unmap. Names and types at this layer wouldn't be
   virt-specific.

 - Memory management for KVM guests that uses the table walker library,
   which we can probably still call the TDP MMU.

Certainly this doesn't need to be addressed in the first series, as the x86
surgery is enough on its own. Nonetheless, it is probably worthwhile to
get the conversation started about how this code can actually be used by
the other arches.
