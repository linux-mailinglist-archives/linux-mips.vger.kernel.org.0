This was just a qu—ñck WIP patch.  If you have some spare time to tackle
it for real I'd sugget the following approach:

 1) Remove the direct references to protection_map in debug_vm_pgtable.c
 2) add the ARCH_HAS_GET_PAGE_PROT symbol that lets architectures
    provide vm_get_page_prot itself and not define protection_map at all
    in this case
 3) convert all architectures that touch protection_map to provide
    vm_get_page_prot themselves
 4) mark protection_map static
 5) convert all architectures that provide arch_filter_pgprot and/or
    arch_vm_get_page_prot to provide vm_get_page_prot directly and
    remove those hooks
 6) remove the __S???/__P??? macros and the generic vm_get_page_prot
    after providing an arch implementation for every architecture.
    This can maybe simplified with a new generic version that directly
    looks at PAGE_* macros, but that will need further investigation
    first.
